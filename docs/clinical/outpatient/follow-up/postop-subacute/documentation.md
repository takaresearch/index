   - Sport: [cleared / gradual return / specific timeline]

4. **Imaging**:
   - [Repeat X-ray at TIMEFRAME if indicated / no further imaging needed]

5. **Follow-up**:
   - **If progressing well**: 
     - Final review in [TIMEFRAME]
     - Then discharge to GP care
   
   - **If concerns persist**:
