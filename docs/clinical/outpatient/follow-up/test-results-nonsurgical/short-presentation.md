# Follow-up: Test Results + Non-Surgical - Short Presentation

## a. History Taking

**Format**: "Returns [DURATION] post initial review. Symptoms [improved/unchanged/worse]. [Treatment adherence]."

**Example**: "Returns 3 months post initial review. Symptoms moderately improved with physiotherapy and orthotics. Still has morning stiffness but walking tolerance increased from 500m to 1km."

**Key Elements**:
- Time since last visit
- Symptom trajectory
- Treatment adherence
- Functional change

---

## b. Examination

**Format**: "Examination: [key changes from baseline]. Imaging: [key findings]."

**Example**: "Examination: reduced tenderness over plantar fascia, improved dorsiflexion 5° to 10°. MRI: moderate plantar fasciitis, no tear, calcaneal enthesopathy."

**Key Elements**:
- Comparative findings (vs baseline)
- Imaging results (plain language)
- Clinical correlation

---

## c. Impression

**Format**: "[DIAGNOSIS] confirmed on imaging. [Progress assessment]."

**Example**: "Plantar fasciitis confirmed on MRI. Partial response to conservative management, functional improvement but persistent symptoms."

**Key Elements**:
- Diagnosis confirmation
- Progress characterization
- Current status

---

## d. Recommendation

**Format**: "Plan: [continue/modify treatment] for [duration]. If [A] then [B], if [C] then [D]. Review [timeframe]."

**Example**: "Plan: Continue physiotherapy, add night splints, consider PRP injection if no further improvement in 6 weeks. If resolved, discharge PRN. Review 2 months."

**Key Elements**:
- Treatment adjustment
- Timeline
- Decision points
- Follow-up plan

"[AGE] [SEX] with [DIAGNOSIS] returns [DURATION] post-initial review. [Symptom trajectory]. [Treatment adherence]. Examination: [changes]. Imaging: [findings]. Impression: [diagnosis] confirmed, [progress assessment]. Plan: [treatment adjustment] for [duration]. If [improved], [action A]. If [not improved], [action B]. Review [timeframe]."

**Example**:

"42F with Achilles tendinopathy returns 3 months post-initial review. Pain improved 60%, now able to walk 2km (vs 500m). Compliant with eccentric exercises and heel lift. Examination: reduced mid-portion tenderness, calf strength improved. MRI: fusiform thickening, grade 2 tendinopathy, no tear. Impression: Achilles tendinopathy, good response to conservative management. Plan: Continue eccentric program for 3 more months, gradual return to running. If asymptomatic, discharge to GP. If plateau or worsen, consider PRP injection. Review 3 months or PRN."
