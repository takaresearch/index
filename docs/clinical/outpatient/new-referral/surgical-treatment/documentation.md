## c. Impression

### Template

**Diagnosis**:
1. [Primary diagnosis requiring surgical intervention]
2. [Contributing factors or concurrent pathology]

**Surgical Indication**:
- Failed conservative management (minimum [DURATION] trial)
- Persistent symptoms with significant functional limitation
- [Specific indication: instability, deformity, refractory pain, structural damage]

**Surgical Goal**: [pain relief / stability restoration / deformity correction / functional improvement]

## d. Recommendation

### Template

**Planned Procedure**: [Specific surgical procedure with laterality]

**Informed Consent Discussion**:

1. **Procedure**: [Description of planned surgery]

2. **Benefits**:
   - [Primary expected benefit]
   - [Secondary benefits]
   - Expected functional outcome

3. **Risks** (discussed in detail):
   - Infection (~1-2%)
   - Nerve injury (numbness, neuropraxia, permanent sensory change)
   - Vascular injury
   - DVT/PE
   - Stiffness, reduced range of motion
   - Recurrence of pathology
   - Non-union / mal-union (if applicable)
   - Hardware complications (if applicable)
   - Need for further surgery
   - Anaesthetic risks

4. **Alternative Options**:
   - Continue conservative management (likely limited benefit given prior trial)
   - Accept current level of function
   - Alternative surgical approaches (if applicable)

5. **Natural History if Untreated**:
   - [Likely progression without intervention]

**Postoperative Pathway**:
- Weight-bearing: [NWB / PWB / WBAT] for [DURATION]
- Immobilization: [DEVICE] for [DURATION]
- Physiotherapy: Commence at [TIMEFRAME], focus on [GOALS]
- Return to driving: [TIMEFRAME]
- Return to work: [TIMEFRAME] depending on occupation
- Return to sport: [TIMEFRAME]
- Expected full recovery: [TIMEFRAME]

**Preoperative Requirements**:
- [Medical clearance if indicated]
- [Imaging requirements]
- [Medication adjustments: anticoagulation, DMARDs]
- [Smoking cessation counseling]

**Next Steps**:
- Patient to consider and confirm decision
- Schedule surgery once decision confirmed
- Provide written information and consent forms
- Arrange preoperative assessment

**Follow-up**: [Contact details for questions, how to proceed if patient wishes to schedule]
