# New Referral: Surgical Treatment - Short Presentation

## a. History Taking

**Format**: "[AGE] [SEX] with [DURATION] history of [PROBLEM], failed [CONSERVATIVE TREATMENTS], now considering surgery."

**Example**: "35F with 18-month history of chronic right ankle instability with recurrent giving way, failed 6 months physiotherapy and bracing, now considering lateral ligament reconstruction."

**Key Elements**:
- Age, sex
- Duration and problem
- Conservative treatments attempted (with duration)
- Indication for surgery

---

## b. Examination

**Format**: "Examination confirms [KEY FINDINGS supporting surgical indication]. Imaging shows [RELEVANT PATHOLOGY]."

**Example**: "Examination confirms severe laxity on anterior drawer and talar tilt testing. MRI demonstrates complete ATFL and CFL tears with no evidence of osteochondral injury."

**Key Elements**:
- Physical findings supporting surgery
- Imaging confirmation
- Relevant negative findings (exclude contraindications)

---

## c. Impression

**Format**: "[DIAGNOSIS] with [failed conservative management / surgical indication]."

**Example**: "Chronic lateral ankle instability with mechanical laxity, failed conservative management, suitable for surgical stabilization."

**Key Elements**:
- Diagnosis
- Why surgery is indicated
- Confirmation suitable for operative intervention

---

## d. Recommendation

**Format**: "Plan: [PROCEDURE]. Discussed risks ([KEY RISKS]), benefits ([KEY BENEFITS]), recovery ([TIMELINE]). Patient to consider and confirm decision."

**Example**: "Plan: Right ankle arthroscopy and lateral ligament reconstruction. Discussed risks (infection, nerve injury, recurrence, DVT), benefits (improved stability, reduced giving-way episodes), recovery (6 weeks NWB in boot, 3-6 months full recovery). Patient to consider and confirm decision for surgical scheduling."

**Key Elements**:
- Specific procedure
- Key risks discussed
- Key benefits
- Recovery timeline
- Patient decision-making status

"[AGE] [SEX] with [DURATION] [PROBLEM], failed [CONSERVATIVE], now considering [PROCEDURE]. Examination: [KEY FINDINGS]. Imaging: [PATHOLOGY]. Impression: [DIAGNOSIS], surgical indication confirmed. Plan: [PROCEDURE], discussed IC (risks: [KEY RISKS]; benefits: [KEY BENEFITS]; recovery: [TIMELINE]). Patient considering, will confirm for scheduling."

**Example**:

"48M with 2-year history of progressive hallux valgus with bunion pain, failed wide shoes and orthotics for 12 months, now considering surgical correction. Examination: severe HV deformity, HA angle ~35°, IM angle ~15°, 2nd MTP joint crossover. X-ray: confirms moderate-severe HV with subluxation. Impression: Symptomatic hallux valgus with 2nd MTP instability, suitable for operative correction. Plan: Scarf osteotomy + 2nd MTP stabilization. Discussed IC (risks: infection, recurrence, stiffness; benefits: pain relief, improved shoe fit; recovery: 6 weeks protected weight-bearing, 3 months full recovery). Patient considering, will confirm for scheduling."
