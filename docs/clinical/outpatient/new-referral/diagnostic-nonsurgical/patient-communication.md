## c. Impression

### Diagnostic Explanation
- Based on what you've told me and what I found on examination, I believe you have [DIAGNOSIS].
- Essentially, this means [SIMPLE EXPLANATION IN PLAIN LANGUAGE].

**Example Explanations**:
- **Plantar fasciitis**: This is inflammation of the thick band of tissue on the bottom of your foot. It's a common cause of heel pain.
- **Achilles tendinopathy**: This is a problem with the tendon at the back of your heel. It can become painful and swollen, often due to overuse.
- **Ankle instability**: The ligaments that hold your ankle stable have been stretched or damaged, which can cause the ankle to feel unstable.

### Differential
- There are a few possibilities we need to consider. The most likely is [DIAGNOSIS], but we should also rule out [ALTERNATIVE].

## d. Recommendation

### Investigation
- I'd like to order [X-RAY / MRI / ULTRASOUND] to get a better picture of what's going on.
- This will help us confirm the diagnosis and plan the best treatment.
- The results should be available in about [TIMEFRAME].

### Conservative Treatment
- I recommend we start with non-surgical treatment. This includes [TREATMENT OPTIONS].
- Let's try [PHYSIOTHERAPY / ORTHOTICS / MEDICATION] for [DURATION] and see how you respond.
- The goal is to [REDUCE PAIN / IMPROVE FUNCTION].
- It may take [TIMEFRAME] to see improvement, so please be patient.

### Follow-up Plan
- I'd like to see you back in [TIMEFRAME] to review the test results and see how you're doing.
- If the symptoms improve, we'll continue with the current treatment.
- If they persist or get worse, we'll need to consider other options like injections or possibly surgery.

### Red Flags
- If things get suddenly worse, or if you notice [increasing numbness, spreading redness, severe pain], please don't wait—call us right away.

### Closing
- Do you have any questions? Please feel free to ask about anything.
- Thank you for coming in today. We'll see you in [TIMEFRAME].
