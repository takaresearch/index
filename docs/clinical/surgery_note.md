# 手術記録の型（術直後に仕上げる）

本ページは、手術記録を「術後に思い出す文章」ではなく、「術中の意思決定と再現可能性を担保する記録」として設計し直すためのテンプレートである。術直後に完成させることを原則とし、必要に応じて **自動読み上げ（音声入力）** と **スクライブ** を併用する。

## 0. 原則

- **適応と術式選択の理由**が記録の核である（手順の羅列ではない）。  
- **術中に分岐した点**（予定変更、追加処置、固定変更）を最優先で残す。  
- 「翌日の自分／他者が読んで再現できる」粒度を担保する。  
- 症例同定性のある情報は公開ページに含めない（必要なら `private/` へ）。

## 2. 音声入力＋スクライブの運用

### 推奨ワークフロー

- **術直後5分**：術式と分岐（予定変更・追加手技・固定方針）だけを音声で粗く記録する。  
- **当日中10分**：テンプレに流し込み、見出しを埋めて整形する。  
- **翌日1分**：客観情報（インプラント型番等）を追記し、完了とする。  

### 失敗しやすい点（予防）

- 手順は書けても「なぜその判断か」が抜ける → **適応と分岐**を冒頭に固定する。  
- インプラント情報が散逸する → 末尾に「固定・インプラント」欄を必置する。  

## 3. 公開運用上の注意（必須）

本テンプレートは公開可能であるが、具体症例に依存する記載（日時、施設、特徴的背景、連続した術中写真等）は症例同定性を生むため、公開ページに載せない。症例記録が必要な場合は、公開外（`private/` 等）へ分離し、匿名化と規程遵守を前提とする。

### Total Ankle Replacement (TAR)

**PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:** Ankle joint arthritis in a setting of previous talar osteochondral defect.

**POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:** Same as preoperative.

**NAME OF PROCEDURES:**
- Total ankle replacement
- Insertion of medial malleolar screw
- Ankle medial and lateral gutter release with ostectomies
- Talonavicular joint arthrotomy and release

**DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:**

The patient was positioned supine on the operating table. A thigh tourniquet was applied and inflated to 300 mmHg. Intravenous antibiotics were administered. The limb was prepped, marked and draped. A primary and secondary time out was performed prior to skin incision.

A midline anterior incision was made over the ankle. An anterior approach was utilized to the ankle joint via the interval of the tibialis anterior and the EHL tendon. The anterior tibial neovascular bundle was identified and protected laterally throughout the operation. The superficial peroneal nerve was identified immediately in the deep subcutaneous cavity and was protected laterally throughout the operation also. An anterior arthrotomy of the ankle joint was made with continued extension down to the level of the talonavicular joint whereby further arthrotomy was made with release medially and laterally of the talonavicular joint.

The patient specific instrumentation jig was applied to the tibia under the use of direct vision and x-ray. Multiple K wires were inserted for positioning under the confirmation of x-ray. The apparatus for the distal tibial cut was applied. The proximal corners were predrilled. The distal tibial cut was made with the use of the cutting jig and with intraoperative x-ray. The distal tibial bone segment was removed. Balancing was examined with the use of a lamina spreader which confirmed there was no significant medial or lateral ligament redundancy or laxity. A medial and lateral gutter release was performed along with ostectomies of the gutters.

The patient specific talus guide was applied under direct vision and the use of intraoperative x-ray. Multiple K wires were inserted for fixation. A talar chamfer cut was made via the use of a cutting jig. A trial of components was performed with equal balancing.

The bony surfaces were prepared. Local bone graft was deposited into the anterior talar chamfer cut. Insertion of the definitive prosthesis was then made. The prosthesis sizes were a Stryker Infinity tibia size 2 with a Stryker Infinity size 2 talar body. A Stryker Infinity 6 mm poly was inserted. The final reduction was stable and well balanced clinically. Final intraoperative x-rays were utilized as well.

The wound was irrigated and closed in a layered manner with 2-0 Vicryl to the arthrotomy and the extensor retinaculum. 3-0 Vicryl sutures were used for the subcutaneous layer and 3-0 nylon sutures were used for the skin closure. A Jelonet and gauze dressing was applied. A below knee Tri slab plaster was applied. The tourniquet was deflated.

**POSTOPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS:** The patient is nonweightbearing in a below knee Tri slab plaster for 3 weeks. The patient requires intravenous antibiotics for 24 hours postoperative. The patient requires aspirin 81 mg b.i.d. orally for 3 weeks for VT prophylaxis. The patient is being prescribed hydromorphone analgesia p.r.n. upon discharge along with vitamin C and vitamin D supplementation.

Follow-up in 3 weeks' time for removal of plaster, inspection of the surgical wound and removal of surgical sutures. Then aim to commence a graduated weightbearing program in a fracture boot following the 3 week review.

### Double Fusion (Subtalar and Talonavicular)

**PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:** Stage 3 posterior tibial tendon deficiency with CT SPECT positive increased uptake in the navicular and posterior aspect of the subtalar joint. The patient was given the option of extraarticular correction and double fusion. In going over the risks and benefits preoperatively, we felt that the safest option for preventing recurrence and patient outcome would be a double fusion.

**POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:** Same as preoperative.

**NAME OF PROCEDURE:**
1. Subtalar fusion with 7-0 Fixos screws
2. Talonavicular fusion with two 4-0 Fixos screws and a 20-20 EasyClip staple
3. Peroneal brevis to longus transfer 3 cm proximal to the tip of the fibula
4. Gastroc recession from medial side approach
5. Bone graft with allograft as well as augment to subtalar talonavicular joints

**DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:**

The patient was brought to the operating room after undergoing a popliteal block with catheter in the block room. The patient was given 2 grams of Ancef and the leg was then prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with a bump under the hip and thigh tourniquet and flannels under the leg that were well padded. The leg was then exsanguinated with an Esmarch and sharp dissection was made over the medial aspect of the gastroc at the musculotendinous junction as there was an equinus contracture 5 degrees short of neutral when the foot was corrected first to the subtalar joint and talonavicular joint. The gastroc was visualized and a dewar was used to clean out the tendon and protect it and the recession was complete making sure we did not have any damage to the sural nerve on the lateral side. This allowed about 10 to 15 degrees of dorsiflexion with the foot corrected and then that skin was closed with a nylon suture at that time and a sterile Mepore dressing was placed over top of it.

Sharp dissection was then made over the tip of the fibula at the subtalar joint, going down to the joint and protecting the CFL. A lateral process was removed with an osteotome and then the joint was prepared with an osteotome to remove the cartilage and a curette to the back along with a skinny rongeur. We were happy with the overall preparation of the joint but did not do any drilling or foraging at this point. We could see the FHL tendon through the joint, ensuring that we had adequate debridement. The posterior half of the subtalar joint was quite arthritic and sclerotic more so than what would have been expected from the CT SPECT scan, but again confirming the benefit of the subtalar fusion for the patient's symptoms at this time.

An incision was made just posterior to the fibula approximately 3 cm up, visualizing the peroneal brevis deep to the peroneal longus. The peroneal brevis was then released at the level of the subtalar joint and pulled up through and then kept in that incision until the tension at the end for the Pulvertaft weave.

Attention was then made over the talonavicular joint where sharp dissection was made. Superficial peroneal nerve was visualized and protected. EHL tendon sheath was then transected sharply. The deep neurovascular bundle was visualized and taken off the TN capsule. The TN capsule was then incised sharply and the TN joint was visualized. Laminar spreader was placed inside and an osteotome and bur were used under low speed to remove the bone off of both the talus and the navicular bone for good preparation. We were happy with the overall preparation. We assessed the ability to correct the foot. Once we were happy with the correction of the subtalar joint as well as talonavicular joint, 2 K-wires were placed to fuse the subtalar joint for 7-0 screws. Once we were happy with their position and that the foot was corrected, the subtalar joint was reduced and the talus was restacked. They were measured and then drilled across. They were verified on lateral AP and Harris heel views to ensure that they were in bone and we were happy with their positioning. We also verified prior to placing these that the K-wires were across the subtalar joint and we were able to reduce and pronate the TN joint to where we wanted it and we were happy with this position. Two K-wire bone grafts with augment were placed into the subtalar joint prior to this as well as the TN joint and packed tightly.

Attention was then made after the 7-0 screws were placed in the subtalar joint to the TN joint where percutaneously 2 medial K-wires were placed that would fit the 4-0 screws. We were happy with their position. Fifty mm 4-0 Fixos screws were inserted, showing good compression and position of the overstacking of the navicular on the talus and good A-P coverage as well. An EasyClip 20 mm staple was then placed laterally to help with rotational control and compression. The ankle was then taken through a full range of motion and verified the foot position. We were happy on x-ray as well as clinical of the strike point of the calcaneus being just slightly lateral to the tibial tubercle as well as the visible arch now on the medial side of the foot and the strike point of the first and fifth rays.

The wounds were irrigated. The capsule was closed with TN joint and the EHL tendon sheath was closed with the TN joint and subcutaneous closure done with 3-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with nylon sutures. The lateral incision and percutaneous holes were closed with nylon sutures and then the Pulvertaft weave was completed under tension with the foot in a neutral position, we tensioned the peroneal brevis as long as possible and pulvertafted it through the longest and sutured and tied it off with a 3-0 PDS. Subcutaneous closure there was done with 3-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with nylon sutures.

A final x-ray was taken. We were happy with the overall positioning and range of motion and a sterile dressing and a tri-slab were placed. The patient will be nonweightbearing for approximately 6 to 12 weeks until x-ray shows signs of healing. Follow-up in 2 to 3 weeks for wound check. DVT prophylaxis, vitamin D and vitamin C prescribed.
