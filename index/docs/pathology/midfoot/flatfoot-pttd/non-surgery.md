# Flatfoot (PTTD) - Non-Surgical Management

## Clinical Presentation

- Medial ankle/midfoot pain and swelling
- Progressive flattening of arch
- Difficulty with single-limb heel rise
- Abduction of forefoot ("too many toes" sign)
- Difficulty walking on uneven terrain

## Classification: Johnson and Strom (Modified by Myerson)

### Stage I
- Tenosynovitis without deformity
- Pain and swelling along PTT
- Normal arch height
- Single heel rise possible (with pain)

### Stage II
- PTT dysfunction with flexible deformity
- Loss of arch, hindfoot valgus
- Forefoot abduction
- Unable to perform single heel rise
- IIA: <30% talonavicular uncovering
- IIB: >40% talonavicular uncovering

### Stage III
- Fixed (rigid) deformity
- Cannot correct manually
- Subtalar arthritis may be present

### Stage IV
- Valgus ankle arthritis
- Deltoid insufficiency

## Diagnosis

### Physical Examination
- **Too Many Toes Sign**: Forefoot abduction
- **Single Heel Rise Test**: Unable or painful
- **Hindfoot Alignment**: Valgus
- **Arch Height**: Collapsed
- **Flexibility**: Assess with Jack test, hindfoot inversion
- **PTT Palpation**: Swelling, tenderness along course
- **Strength Testing**: Resisted inversion weakness

### Imaging
- **Weight-bearing X-rays** (essential)
  - AP, lateral, hindfoot alignment view
- **Lateral**: Decreased calcaneal pitch, increased talo-1st MT angle
- **AP**: Talonavicular uncovering, increased talus-1st MT angle
- **MRI**: Evaluate PTT (hypertrophy, tear, degeneration)

## Non-Surgical Treatment

### Indications
- Stage I disease
- Stage II with minimal deformity
- Low-demand patients
- Medical comorbidities precluding surgery
- Patient preference

### Treatment Options

#### 1. Immobilization (Acute Phase)
- CAM boot or short leg cast
- 4-6 weeks
- Allow inflammation to settle
- Non-weight bearing if severe

#### 2. Orthotic Management (Mainstay)
- **UCBL (University of California Biomechanics Lab)**: Rigid, controls hindfoot
- **AFO (Ankle-Foot Orthosis)**: For Stage III or severe Stage II
- **Custom arch support**: Less aggressive, better tolerated
- **Medial heel wedge**: Decreases valgus stress

**Fitting:**
- Must be custom-molded
- Firm posting at hindfoot
- Arch support
- Deep heel cup

#### 3. Physical Therapy
- Stretching: Gastrocnemius-soleus complex
- Strengthening: PTT, intrinsics, invertors
- Proprioception training
- Gait training

#### 4. Pharmacological
- NSAIDs for inflammation
- Activity modification
- Weight loss if appropriate

#### 5. Injection (Controversial)
- Corticosteroid around (not into) tendon
- Risk of tendon rupture
- Generally avoided

### Brace Options by Stage

| Stage | Orthotic | Comments |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Stage I | Medial arch support | Off-the-shelf possible |
| Stage IIA | UCBL or custom AFO | Custom-molded |
| Stage IIB-III | Rigid AFO (Arizona, Richie) | Controls hindfoot and ankle |
| Stage IV | Rigid AFO or KAFO | May need knee control |

## Success Rates
- Stage I: 50-90% improve with immobilization and orthotics
- Stage II: 30-50% adequate symptom relief
- Stage III-IV: Bracing for symptom control, not corrective

## Patient Education
- Progressive condition without surgery
- Orthotic compliance critical
- May need lifelong bracing
- Surgery often eventually needed for Stage II-III
- Risk factors: Obesity, hypertension, diabetes, age, female

## When to Consider Surgery
- Failed conservative treatment (3-6 months minimum)
- Progressive deformity
- Inability to brace adequately
- Young, active patient
- Stage IIB or greater

## Follow-up
- Reassess at 6-12 weeks
- Ensure proper orthotic fit
- Monitor for progression
- Serial X-rays if worsening symptoms
- Discuss surgery if no improvement
