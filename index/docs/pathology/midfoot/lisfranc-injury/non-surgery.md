# Lisfranc Injury - Non-Surgical Management

## Clinical Presentation

- Midfoot pain and swelling
- Difficulty weight-bearing
- Plantar ecchymosis (high suspicion for Lisfranc injury)
- Often from low-energy mechanism (twist, fall)
- High-energy trauma in MVA, crush injuries

## Anatomy

- **Lisfranc Joint Complex**: Tarsometatarsal (TMT) joints
- **Lisfranc Ligament**: Strongest, connects medial cuneiform to 2nd metatarsal base
- **Keystone**: 2nd metatarsal base recessed, provides stability
- **Ligament Injury**: Leads to instability and deformity

## Classification

### Mechanism
- **Low-energy**: Twist injury, fall (indirect)
- **High-energy**: MVA, crush (direct)

### Myerson Classification
- **Type A**: Total incongruity (all TMT joints)
- **Type B**: Partial incongruity
  - B1: Medial (1st TMT)
  - B2: Lateral (2nd-5th TMT)
- **Type C**: Divergent (medial and lateral separation)

### Stability
- **Stable**: <2mm displacement, no diastasis
- **Unstable**: >2mm displacement, any diastasis

## Diagnosis

### Physical Examination
- **Plantar Ecchymosis**: Pathognomonic sign
- **Midfoot Swelling**: Diffuse
- **Tenderness**: Over TMT joints
- **Piano Key Test**: Dorsoplantar stress causes pain, instability
- **Abduction Stress**: Reproduces pain
- **Passive Forefoot Pronation/Supination**: Pain with stress

### Imaging
- **Weight-bearing X-rays** (Essential if possible)
  - AP, lateral, oblique foot
- **Non-weight-bearing X-rays**: May miss subtle instability
- **Key Findings:**
  - Diastasis between 1st and 2nd metatarsal (>2mm)
  - Loss of alignment at TMT joints
  - Fractures of metatarsal bases or cuneiforms
  
- **CT Scan**: Better visualization of fractures, joint subluxation
- **MRI**: Assess Lisfranc ligament integrity, occult fractures
- **Weight-bearing CT**: Gold standard for subtle instability

### Suspicious Findings Requiring Further Workup
- Fleck sign (avulsion fracture)
- Any diastasis between 1st and 2nd metatarsal
- Loss of alignment at TMT joints
- Plantar ecchymosis

## Non-Surgical Treatment

### Indications (RARE - Most require surgery)
- **No diastasis** (<2mm)
- **Anatomic alignment** on weight-bearing X-rays
- **No fracture displacement**
- **Stable** injury pattern
- Low-demand patient

### Treatment Protocol

#### Phase 1: Acute Immobilization (0-6 weeks)
- Short leg cast
- Non-weight bearing
- Strict compliance required
- Ice, elevation

#### Phase 2: Progressive Loading (6-12 weeks)
- Repeat X-rays at 6 weeks
- If stable: CAM boot, protected weight-bearing
- Continue non-weight bearing if any displacement

#### Phase 3: Return to Activity (3-6 months)
- Gradual weight-bearing
- Custom orthotic with arch support
- Strengthening program
- Carbon fiber insert or rigid sole shoe

### Critical Monitoring
- **Serial X-rays**: Weekly for first 3 weeks, then at 6 weeks
- **Weight-bearing X-rays at 6 weeks**: Essential to confirm stability
- **Any displacement**: Convert to surgery immediately

## Patient Education

### Key Points
- **High risk of displacement**: Even "stable" injuries may displace
- **Importance of compliance**: No weight-bearing, frequent X-rays
- **Threshold for surgery**: Any displacement >2mm requires surgery
- **Long-term implications**: Risk of post-traumatic arthritis
- **Arch support**: Lifelong need for arch support/orthotics
- **Return to sports**: May take 6-12 months

### Warning Signs
- Increased pain
- Feeling of instability
- Unable to maintain non-weight bearing
- → Immediate X-ray needed

## Outcomes of Non-Surgical Treatment

- **Success Rate**: Variable, many studies show high failure rate
- **Risk of Displacement**: 15-30% may displace even with casting
- **Post-traumatic Arthritis**: Can occur even with anatomic reduction
- **Functional Outcomes**: Generally worse than surgical treatment for unstable injuries

## When to Convert to Surgery

### Absolute Indications
- Any displacement >2mm on follow-up X-rays
- Persistent pain despite immobilization
- Patient non-compliance with non-weight bearing
- Athlete or high-demand patient

### Relative Indications
- Even "stable" injuries may benefit from surgery
- Low threshold for surgical fixation

## Follow-up Protocol

- **Week 1-2**: X-rays, assess for displacement
- **Week 3**: X-rays
- **Week 6**: Weight-bearing X-rays (critical)
- **Week 12**: X-rays, assess healing
- **Thereafter**: Monitor for arthritis development

## Important Caveats

### Low Threshold for Surgery
- Many experts recommend surgery for **ALL** Lisfranc ligament injuries
- Non-operative treatment only for:
  - Isolated cuneonavicular injuries
  - Pure midfoot sprains without ligamentous disruption
  - Truly stable injuries confirmed on weight-bearing X-rays

### Subtle Instability
- Standard X-rays may miss instability
- Weight-bearing imaging essential
- CT or MRI if clinical suspicion high

## Key Points

1. **Lisfranc injuries are often UNSTABLE** → Most require surgery
2. **Non-operative treatment** reserved for truly stable injuries only
3. **Serial X-rays mandatory** to detect displacement
4. **Weight-bearing X-rays at 6 weeks** are critical
5. **Low threshold** for converting to surgical treatment
6. **Plantar ecchymosis** = high suspicion for Lisfranc injury
7. **Long-term arch support** needed regardless of treatment
