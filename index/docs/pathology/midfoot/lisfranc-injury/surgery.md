# Lisfranc Injury - Surgical Management

## Indications for Surgery

- **Diastasis >2mm** between 1st and 2nd metatarsal
- **Any displacement** at TMT joints
- **Unstable injury** on weight-bearing X-rays
- **Fracture displacement**
- **High-demand athlete**
- Most Lisfranc ligament injuries (low threshold for surgery)

## Timing of Surgery

- **Acute (<3 weeks)**: ORIF if soft tissue permits
- **Delayed (if severe swelling)**: Wait for "wrinkle sign" (7-14 days)
- **Subacute (3-6 weeks)**: ORIF still possible
- **Chronic (>6 weeks)**: May need arthrodesis

## Surgical Options

### 1. Open Reduction Internal Fixation (ORIF)

#### Indications
- Acute injuries (<6 weeks)
- Minimal arthritis
- Young, active patients
- Reducible displacement

#### Technique
- **Incisions**: Typically 2 dorsal incisions (medial and lateral)
- **Reduction**: Anatomic reduction essential (<2mm displacement)
- **Fixation Options:**

  **A. Screw Fixation (Traditional)**
  - Solid screws 1st-2nd TMT (across Lisfranc ligament)
  - Screws for other TMT joints as needed
  - Biomechanically strongest
  - **Disadvantage**: Requires hardware removal (6-12 months)

  **B. K-wire Fixation**
  - Temporary fixation
  - Less stiff than screws
  - Risk of wire breakage, migration

  **C. Suture-Button (TightRope)**
  - Flexible fixation across 1st-2nd TMT
  - Allows micro-motion
  - No hardware removal needed
  - Emerging technique, mixed early results

#### Outcomes
- **Good to excellent**: 50-70% (lower than expected)
- **Return to sports**: 6-12 months
- **Hardware removal**: Required at 3-6 months for screws
- **Post-traumatic arthritis**: 25-50% develop regardless

### 2. Primary Arthrodesis

#### Indications
- Severe comminution
- Chronic injury (>6-12 weeks)
- Pre-existing arthritis
- Revision surgery
- Older, lower-demand patients

#### Technique
- Remove cartilage from affected TMT joints
- Reduce anatomically
- Fixation with screws or plates
- May fuse 1st-3rd TMT joints (most mobile)
- Consider preserving 4th-5th TMT (more mobile laterally)

#### Outcomes
- **Good to excellent**: 60-80%
- **Return to activity**: 6-12 months
- **Advantages**: Single surgery, no hardware removal, durable
- **Disadvantages**: Loss of midfoot motion (usually minimal impact)

### 3. Anatomic Ligament Reconstruction

#### Indications
- Isolated Lisfranc ligament rupture
- No fracture displacement
- Chronic instability

#### Technique
- Reconstruct Lisfranc ligament with tendon graft or suture tape
- Anatomic drill tunnels
- Secure with interference screws

#### Outcomes
- Limited long-term data
- May preserve motion better than arthrodesis

## Decision Making: ORIF vs. Primary Arthrodesis

| Factor | ORIF | Primary Arthrodesis |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| **Injury timing** | Acute (<6 weeks) | Chronic (>6-12 weeks) |
| **Age** | Younger | Older |
| **Activity level** | High (athlete) | Low to moderate |
| **Fracture pattern** | Minimal comminution | Severe comminution |
| **Joint surface** | Intact | Damaged |
| **Surgeon preference** | Varies | Varies |

### Controversy
- Some surgeons advocate **primary arthrodesis** for ALL Lisfranc injuries
- Rationale: High rate of post-traumatic arthritis after ORIF, often requiring later fusion
- Others prefer ORIF to preserve motion

## Specific Techniques

### Which Joints to Fix/Fuse?

**Medial Column (1st-3rd TMT):**
- Must be rigidly stable
- Fix/fuse all displaced joints

**Lateral Column (4th-5th TMT):**
- More mobile naturally
- May use flexible fixation or no fixation if stable

### Reduction Techniques
- Use pointed reduction forceps
- Temporary K-wire fixation
- Confirm with fluoroscopy (AP, lateral, oblique)
- Anatomic alignment critical (<2mm)

### Fixation Constructs
- **1st TMT**: Plate or screw (medial to lateral)
- **2nd TMT**: Screw from medial cuneiform into 2nd MT base
- **3rd TMT**: Screw as needed
- **4th-5th TMT**: K-wires or screws if unstable

## Postoperative Protocol

### ORIF
**Weeks 0-6:**
- Short leg cast or splint
- Non-weight bearing
- Elevation

**Weeks 6-8:**
- Weight-bearing X-rays to confirm stability
- If stable: CAM boot, progressive weight-bearing

**Weeks 8-12:**
- Progressive weight-bearing
- Physical therapy
- ROM exercises

**Months 3-6:**
- Hardware removal at 3-6 months (if screws across 1st-2nd TMT)
- Return to activity after hardware removal

**Months 6-12:**
- Return to sports
- May need arch support long-term

### Primary Arthrodesis
**Weeks 0-8:**
- Short leg cast
- Non-weight bearing

**Weeks 8-12:**
- CAM boot, progressive weight-bearing
- Once fusion evident on X-ray

**Months 3-6:**
- Return to regular shoes with orthotic
- Continue strengthening

**Months 6-12:**
- Return to sports
- Full recovery 12 months

## Complications

### Intraoperative
- Difficulty achieving reduction
- Neurovascular injury
- Fracture during fixation

### Postoperative
- **Loss of reduction** (10-15%)
- **Hardware failure** (K-wire breakage, screw loosening)
- **Infection** (3-5%)
- **Wound healing problems**
- **Post-traumatic arthritis** (25-50%)
- **Chronic pain** (common)
- **Nonunion** (5-10% for arthrodesis)
- **Malunion**
- **Complex regional pain syndrome** (5%)

### Long-term
- **Arthritis** at TMT joints (very common)
- **Midfoot stiffness**
- **Chronic pain**
- **Altered gait**
- May require later arthrodesis

## Outcomes

### ORIF
- **Good to excellent results**: 50-70%
- **Return to pre-injury level**: 50-60%
- **Post-traumatic arthritis**: 25-50%
- **Require later arthrodesis**: 10-25%

### Primary Arthrodesis
- **Good to excellent results**: 60-80%
- **Return to activity**: 70-80%
- **Single surgery**: Advantage
- **Patient satisfaction**: Often higher than ORIF

## Revision Surgery

### Indications
- Loss of reduction after ORIF
- Persistent pain and instability
- Progressive arthritis

### Options
- Revision ORIF (if early)
- Conversion to arthrodesis (most common)
- Salvage arthrodesis

## Key Surgical Principles

1. **Anatomic reduction mandatory**: <2mm displacement
2. **Stabilize medial column rigidly**: 1st-3rd TMT
3. **Consider primary arthrodesis** for severe injuries, older patients
4. **Hardware removal** required for screws across 1st-2nd TMT (ORIF)
5. **Long-term arch support** often needed
6. **Counsel about arthritis risk**: Common despite good surgery
7. **Low threshold for surgery**: Better outcomes than non-operative treatment

## Special Considerations

### Athletes
- ORIF preferred to preserve motion
- Realistic expectations about return to pre-injury level
- May need 9-12 months

### Polytrauma
- May be missed in setting of multiple injuries
- High index of suspicion needed

### Compartment Syndrome
- Can occur with high-energy Lisfranc injuries
- Monitor closely, consider prophylactic fasciotomies

## Future Directions

- Suture-button fixation (emerging)
- Biologic augmentation
- Better prediction of who will develop arthritis
