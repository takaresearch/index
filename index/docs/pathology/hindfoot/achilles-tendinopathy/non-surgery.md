# Achilles Tendinopathy - Non-Surgical Management

## Clinical Presentation

- Posterior heel pain, 2-6 cm proximal to insertion
- Morning stiffness
- Pain with activity that may improve with warm-up
- Pain after activity
- Thickened, tender tendon

## Classification

### Insertional Tendinopathy
- Pain at calcaneal insertion
- Associated with Haglund's deformity
- Calcification within tendon

### Non-insertional (Midsubstance) Tendinopathy
- Pain 2-6 cm proximal to insertion
- Nodular thickening
- More common

## Diagnosis

### Physical Examination
- Palpable nodule or thickening
- Tenderness to palpation
- Pain with resisted plantarflexion
- Decreased strength
- Assess for gastroc tightness (>10° dorsiflexion deficit)

### Imaging
- **X-ray**: Calcaneal spurring (insertional), calcification
- **Ultrasound**: Thickening, hypoechoic areas, neovascularization
- **MRI**: Reserved for surgical planning or differential diagnosis

## Non-Surgical Treatment

### Phase 1: Acute Management (0-2 weeks)
- Relative rest (avoid aggravating activities)
- Ice 15-20 minutes, 3-4x daily
- NSAIDs (controversial - may impair healing)
- Heel lift (temporarily reduce strain)

### Phase 2: Progressive Loading (2-12 weeks)
**Eccentric Exercise Protocol (Alfredson Protocol)**
- 3 sets of 15 reps, twice daily
- Straight knee (gastrocnemius)
- Bent knee (soleus)
- Gradual increase in load

### Phase 3: Return to Activity (3-6 months)
- Sport-specific training
- Progressive running program
- Maintain strengthening

### Additional Modalities
- **Physical Therapy**
  - Eccentric strengthening
  - Gastrocnemius stretching
  - Deep tissue massage
  - Gait analysis and correction
  
- **Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (ESWT)**
  - Moderate evidence for chronic cases
  - 3-5 sessions over weeks
  
- **Injection Therapy** (controversial)
  - PRP (platelet-rich plasma): mixed evidence
  - Avoid corticosteroids (risk of rupture)

### Orthotic Management
- Heel lift to reduce strain
- Proper footwear with cushioned heel
- Avoid flat shoes

## Success Rates
- 70-80% improve with eccentric exercises
- May take 3-6 months to see results
- Chronic cases (>6 months) more resistant

## Patient Education
- Avoid "pushing through pain"
- Compliance with exercises critical
- Long recovery timeframe
- Avoid steroid injections
- Risk of progression to rupture if untreated

## Follow-up
- Reassess at 6-12 weeks
- If no improvement after 3-6 months conservative treatment, consider surgery
