# Achilles Tendinopathy - Surgical Management

## Indications for Surgery

- Failed conservative treatment (minimum 6 months)
- Significant functional limitation
- Chronic, recalcitrant pain
- Large tendon tear (>50%)

## Surgical Options

### 1. Open Debridement with/without FHL Transfer

**For Non-Insertional Tendinopathy:**

**Technique:**
- Posteromedial longitudinal incision
- Identify and debride diseased tissue
- If >50% tendon debrided: FHL transfer for reinforcement
- Repair remaining healthy tendon

**FHL Transfer Technique:**
- Harvest FHL through same incision
- Create tunnel in calcaneus
- Transfer and secure with interference screw or suture anchor

**Outcomes:**
- 80-90% good to excellent results
- Return to activity 4-6 months
- FHL transfer when needed: 85-95% success

### 2. Insertional Tendinopathy Repair

**Technique:**
- Midline or medial longitudinal incision
- Detach Achilles insertion
- Resect calcaneal prominence (Haglund's)
- Excise calcification and diseased tissue
- Create bone trough in calcaneus
- Reattach tendon with suture anchors

**Outcomes:**
- 75-90% satisfaction
- Higher complication rate than midsubstance
- Wound healing issues more common

### 3. Minimally Invasive Options

**Gastrocnemius Recession:**
- For isolated gastrocnemius contracture
- Strayer (intramuscular) or Baumann (aponeurotic) recession
- Can be combined with debridement

**Percutaneous Longitudinal Tenotomies:**
- Multiple longitudinal incisions in tendon
- Stimulates healing response
- Limited evidence

**Outcomes:**
- Less invasive
- Faster recovery
- May be inadequate for severe cases

## Decision Making

```
Tendinopathy Type:
├─ Non-insertional + <50% involvement
│  └─ Open debridement
├─ Non-insertional + >50% involvement
│  └─ Open debridement + FHL transfer
├─ Insertional + bone spur
│  └─ Detachment, spur resection, repair
└─ With gastrocnemius contracture
   └─ Add gastrocnemius recession
```

## Special Considerations

### FHL Transfer
**Indications:**
- >50% tendon excision
- Chronic rupture repair
- Revision surgery

**Advantages:**
- Strong transfer (toe flexor)
- In-phase with Achilles
- Minimal donor morbidity

**Disadvantages:**
- Loss of great toe push-off strength (usually minimal)
- Technically demanding

### Haglund's Deformity
- Resect adequate bone without destabilizing insertion
- Smooth bone edges
- May need calcaneal osteotomy if severe

## Postoperative Protocol

### Weeks 0-2
- Posterior splint in equinus
- Non-weight bearing
- Wound care

### Weeks 2-6
- CAM boot in equinus (20-30° plantarflexion)
- Non-weight bearing
- Begin gentle ankle pumps

### Weeks 6-8
- Progress boot to neutral
- Begin protected weight-bearing
- ROM exercises

### Weeks 8-12
- Full weight-bearing in boot
- Progressive strengthening
- Wean from boot

### Months 3-6
- Running program begins at 4 months
- Sports at 6 months
- Full return to activity 6-12 months

**If FHL Transfer:**
- More conservative progression
- Non-weight bearing 4 weeks
- Full activity 9-12 months

## Complications

- Wound healing problems (10-15% insertional)
- Sural nerve injury
- Re-rupture (rare with proper rehab)
- Persistent pain or stiffness
- Weakness
- Deep venous thrombosis

## Outcomes

| Procedure | Success Rate | Return to Sport | Satisfaction |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Midsubstance debridement | 80-90% | 4-6 months | 85-90% |
| + FHL transfer | 85-95% | 6-9 months | 90% |
| Insertional repair | 75-90% | 6-9 months | 75-85% |
| Gastrocnemius recession | 70-80% | 3-4 months | 80% |

## Key Points

- Surgery reserved for chronic cases failing 6+ months conservative treatment
- FHL transfer for large defects improves outcomes
- Insertional repair has higher complication rate
- Patient selection and realistic expectations crucial
- Prolonged rehabilitation required
