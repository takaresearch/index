# Ankle Instability - Non-Surgical Management

## Clinical Presentation

- Recurrent ankle "giving way"
- Feeling of instability, especially on uneven ground
- Recurrent swelling after minor injury
- Chronic pain or achiness
- History of significant ankle sprain

## Classification

### Mechanical Instability
- Objective ligamentous laxity
- Positive stress tests
- Documented on imaging

### Functional Instability
- Subjective instability
- Normal stress tests
- Proprioceptive deficit

### Ligaments Involved
- **ATFL** (anterior talofibular) - most common, injured first
- **CFL** (calcaneofibular) - injured with more severe sprains
- **PTFL** (posterior talofibular) - rarely injured in isolation

## Diagnosis

### History
- Mechanism of initial injury
- Frequency of giving way episodes
- Activities that provoke instability
- Previous treatment and response

### Physical Examination
- **Anterior Drawer Test**
  - ATFL integrity
  - >5mm anterior translation = positive
  - Side-to-side comparison
  
- **Talar Tilt Test**
  - CFL integrity
  - >10° difference compared to contralateral = positive
  
- **Subtalar Instability**
  - Medial-lateral drawer
  
- **Peroneal Strength**
  - Often weak on affected side
  
- **Single Leg Stance**
  - Assessment of proprioception

### Imaging
- **X-ray**: Weight-bearing AP, lateral, mortise
  - Rule out bony injury, arthritis, osteochondral lesion
  - May show talar tilt or OCD
  
- **Stress X-rays** (rarely done now)
  - Anterior drawer or talar tilt under stress
  
- **MRI**
  - Evaluate ligaments, osteochondral lesions
  - High-grade tears, bone edema
  - Not always necessary for clinical diagnosis

## Non-Surgical Treatment

### Indications
- First-time instability
- Functional instability without mechanical laxity
- Low-demand patients
- Willing to modify activities

### Treatment Protocol

#### Phase 1: Acute Management (if recent sprain)
- RICE protocol (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation)
- Protected weight-bearing with brace
- NSAIDs for pain/swelling

#### Phase 2: Rehabilitation (Primary Treatment)

**1. Proprioception Training** (Most Important)
- Single leg stance
- Balance board exercises
- Progression to unstable surfaces
- Eyes closed progression

**2. Peroneal Strengthening**
- Resistance band eversion exercises
- Multi-directional strengthening
- Eccentric exercises
- Progress to functional movements

**3. Range of Motion**
- Ankle pumps, circles
- Gastrocnemius/soleus stretching
- Joint mobilization

**4. Functional Training**
- Sport-specific drills
- Agility exercises
- Plyometrics
- Return to sport progression

#### Phase 3: Maintenance
- Continue proprioception exercises
- Maintain peroneal strength
- Bracing for high-risk activities

### Bracing Options
- **Lace-up ankle brace**: Good support, adjustable
- **Semi-rigid brace**: Maximum support
- **Taping**: Temporary support for sports
- **Prophylactic bracing** for high-risk sports

## Success Rates
- 50-80% of patients improve with structured rehabilitation
- Better results in functional vs. mechanical instability
- Compliance with exercises critical
- May take 3-6 months for full benefit

## Patient Education
- Natural history: Risk of recurrent sprains without treatment
- Importance of proprioceptive training
- Bracing may be needed long-term for sports
- Risk of developing arthritis with repeated sprains
- Surgery option if conservative treatment fails

## When to Consider Surgery
- Failed rehabilitation (minimum 3-6 months)
- Mechanical instability with continued episodes
- High-demand athlete
- Associated pathology (OCD, arthritis)

## Follow-up
- Reassess at 6-12 weeks
- Ensure compliance with exercises
- Adjust program based on progress
- Discuss surgical options if no improvement at 3-6 months
