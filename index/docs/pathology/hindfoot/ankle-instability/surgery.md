# Ankle Instability - Surgical Management

## Indications for Surgery

- Failed conservative treatment (minimum 3-6 months structured rehab)
- Recurrent instability affecting quality of life
- Mechanical instability with objective laxity
- High-demand athletes
- Associated pathology requiring surgery (OCD, arthritis)

## Preoperative Considerations

### Patient Selection
- Realistic expectations
- Willing to complete rehabilitation
- Appropriate activity level
- No significant arthritis

### Associated Pathology (Common)
- Osteochondral defects (25%)
- Peroneal tendon pathology
- Bone impingement
- Must address these at time of surgery

## Surgical Options

### 1. Anatomic Lateral Ligament Reconstruction

#### Broström Procedure (Gold Standard)
**Technique:**
- Direct repair of ATFL and CFL
- Advance and imbricate torn ligaments
- Anchor to fibula

**Gould Modification:**
- Add inferior extensor retinaculum reinforcement
- Improved strength

**Indications:**
- Primary reconstruction
- Good tissue quality
- Normal BMI
- Normal alignment

**Outcomes:**
- 85-95% good to excellent results
- Return to sport 3-6 months
- Low recurrence rate (5-10%)
- Preserves normal ankle kinematics

#### Broström-Gould with Suture Tape Augmentation
**Technique:**
- Standard Broström repair
- Add internal brace (suture tape) for reinforcement
- Allows earlier mobilization

**Advantages:**
- Potentially faster recovery
- Additional security
- May allow earlier weight-bearing

**Outcomes:**
- Similar to standard Broström (limited long-term data)
- May reduce re-rupture risk

### 2. Non-Anatomic Tendon Transfer Reconstructions

#### Chrisman-Snook Procedure
**Technique:**
- Split peroneus brevis tendon
- Route through fibula and calcaneus
- Recreate ATFL and CFL

**Indications:**
- Revision surgery
- Poor tissue quality
- Failed Broström
- Cavovarus foot

**Disadvantages:**
- Altered ankle kinematics
- Potential stiffness
- Peroneal weakness

**Outcomes:**
- 70-85% good results
- Higher stiffness rate
- Reserved for salvage

### 3. Arthroscopic-Assisted Repair
**Technique:**
- Arthroscopy first: evaluate and treat intra-articular pathology
- Then perform open or percutaneous Broström

**Advantages:**
- Address OCD, loose bodies, synovitis
- Comprehensive treatment

**Outcomes:**
- Comparable to open Broström
- Advantage of addressing intra-articular pathology

## Decision Algorithm

```
First-time Surgery + Good Tissue:
└─ Broström-Gould (± suture tape augmentation)

Revision Surgery or Poor Tissue:
└─ Non-anatomic reconstruction (Chrisman-Snook)

Associated OCD/Intra-articular Pathology:
└─ Arthroscopic-assisted Broström

Cavovarus Deformity:
└─ Correct deformity first, then Broström or tendon transfer
```

## Adjunctive Procedures

### Address Underlying Deformity
- **Cavovarus foot**: Calcaneal osteotomy, plantar fascia release
- **Valgus hindfoot**: Correct with osteotomy
- **Gastrocnemius contracture**: Recession

### Treat Associated Pathology
- OCD: Microfracture, OAT
- Synovitis: Synovectomy
- Bone impingement: Remove anterolateral osteophytes
- Peroneal pathology: Debride, repair if needed

## Postoperative Protocol

### Standard Broström-Gould

**Weeks 0-2:**
- Posterior splint
- Non-weight bearing
- Elevation, ice

**Weeks 2-6:**
- CAM boot
- Non-weight bearing weeks 2-4
- Protected weight-bearing weeks 4-6
- Begin gentle ankle ROM

**Weeks 6-8:**
- Wean from boot
- Progressive weight-bearing
- Increase ROM exercises

**Weeks 8-12:**
- Strengthening program
- Proprioception training
- Pool exercises, bike

**Months 3-6:**
- Running progression at 3-4 months
- Sport-specific training
- Return to sports at 4-6 months

### With Suture Tape Augmentation
- May allow earlier weight-bearing (week 2-4)
- Otherwise similar protocol

### Tendon Transfer (Chrisman-Snook)
- More conservative protocol
- Non-weight bearing 4-6 weeks
- Slower return to activities (6-9 months)

## Complications

- Recurrent instability (5-10% Broström, higher with tenodesis)
- Stiffness (more common with tenodesis)
- Peroneal weakness
- Sural nerve injury (numbness lateral foot)
- Wound healing problems
- Complex regional pain syndrome (rare)
- Over-tightening causing pain

## Outcomes by Procedure

| Procedure | Success Rate | Recurrence | Return to Sport | Patient Satisfaction |
|-----------|--------------|------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Broström | 85-95% | 5-10% | 4-6 months | 90-95% |
| Broström + Augmentation | 90-95% | 5% | 3-5 months | 90-95% |
| Chrisman-Snook | 70-85% | 10-15% | 6-9 months | 75-85% |

## Key Points

- Broström-Gould is gold standard for primary reconstruction
- Arthroscopy helps identify and treat associated pathology (25% have OCD)
- Must address underlying deformity (cavovarus)
- Rehabilitation compliance critical for success
- Suture tape augmentation may allow faster recovery
- Tendon transfers reserved for revision or poor tissue
