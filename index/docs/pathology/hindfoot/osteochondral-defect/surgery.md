# Osteochondral Defect (OCD) - Surgical Management

## Indications for Surgery

- Failed conservative treatment (3-6 months)
- Unstable lesion on MRI
- Large lesion (>15mm)
- Symptomatic cyst formation
- Persistent pain and dysfunction

## Surgical Options

### 1. Bone Marrow Stimulation (Microfracture)
**Indications:**
- Lesions <15mm
- First-line surgical treatment
- Good subchondral bone

**Technique:**
- Arthroscopic approach
- Debride unstable cartilage to stable rim
- Create multiple perforations in subchondral bone
- Induces fibrocartilage formation

**Outcomes:**
- 70-85% good results for lesions <15mm
- Results decline with larger lesions
- Fibrocartilage (not hyaline cartilage)

### 2. Osteochondral Autograft Transfer (OAT/OATS)
**Indications:**
- Lesions 10-20mm
- Failed microfracture
- Requires hyaline cartilage restoration

**Technique:**
- Harvest plugs from ipsilateral knee
- Usually need medial malleolar osteotomy for medial lesions
- Press-fit plugs into prepared defect

**Outcomes:**
- 85-90% good results
- Provides hyaline cartilage
- Donor site morbidity (knee pain 5-10%)

### 3. Osteochondral Allograft
**Indications:**
- Large lesions (>20mm)
- Significant bone loss
- Salvage procedure

**Technique:**
- Fresh or preserved allograft
- Malleolar osteotomy often needed
- Secure with screws

**Outcomes:**
- Variable results
- Best for large defects
- Risk of disease transmission (minimal)

### 4. Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (ACI/MACI)
**Indications:**
- Large lesions (>20mm)
- Failed previous surgery
- Minimal bone loss

**Technique:**
- Two-stage procedure
- Stage 1: Harvest chondrocytes arthroscopically
- Stage 2 (6-8 weeks later): Implant cultured cells

**Outcomes:**
- 75-85% good results
- Expensive
- Two surgeries required
- Good for large, isolated defects

## Access Approaches

### Arthroscopic
- Small to medium anterior/central lesions
- Minimal morbidity
- Limited access to posterior lesions

### Medial Malleolar Osteotomy
- Medial talar dome lesions
- Excellent exposure
- 5% nonunion risk

### Lateral Approach
- Lateral talar dome lesions
- Through fibula or anterior to fibula

## Decision Algorithm

```
Lesion Size:
├─ <15mm → Microfracture
├─ 15-20mm → OAT or Microfracture
└─ >20mm → Allograft or ACI/MACI

Bone Loss:
├─ Minimal → Microfracture, OAT, or ACI
└─ Significant → Allograft

Previous Surgery:
└─ Failed Microfracture → OAT, Allograft, or ACI
```

## Postoperative Management

### General Protocol
- Non-weight bearing 6-8 weeks
- CPM (continuous passive motion) if available
- Progressive weight-bearing weeks 8-12
- Return to sports 6-12 months

### Activity Restrictions
- Avoid high-impact activities initially
- Gradual return to sport-specific training
- Full return when strength and ROM restored

## Outcomes by Procedure

| Procedure | Success Rate | Return to Sport | Longevity |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Microfracture | 70-85% | 6-9 months | 5-10 years |
| OAT | 85-90% | 9-12 months | 10+ years |
| Allograft | 70-80% | 12+ months | Variable |
| ACI/MACI | 75-85% | 12+ months | 10+ years |

## Complications

- Persistent pain
- Ankle stiffness
- Graft failure or non-incorporation
- Donor site morbidity (OAT)
- Osteotomy nonunion
- Progression to ankle arthritis
