# Osteochondral Defect (OCD) - Non-Surgical Management

## Clinical Presentation

- Persistent ankle pain after sprain
- Deep, aching pain in the ankle
- Catching or locking sensation
- Swelling
- Instability

## Diagnosis

### Physical Examination
- Point tenderness over talus
- Pain with dorsiflexion (anterior lesions)
- Pain with plantarflexion (posterior lesions)
- Assess for ankle instability

### Imaging
- **X-ray**: May show lesion (AP, lateral, mortise)
- **MRI**: Gold standard for diagnosis
  - Assess lesion size, location, stability
  - Bone edema pattern
- **CT**: Better for bone detail

### Classification
- **Location**: Medial vs. lateral talar dome
- **Size**: <15mm (small), 15-20mm (medium), >20mm (large)
- **Stability**: Stable vs. unstable (on MRI)

## Non-Surgical Treatment

### Indications
- Stable lesions
- Asymptomatic lesions
- Small lesions (<15mm)
- Acute lesions with minimal displacement

### Treatment Protocol

#### Phase 1: Rest and Protection (0-6 weeks)
- Non-weight bearing or protected weight-bearing
- CAM boot or cast
- Cryotherapy
- NSAIDs for pain control

#### Phase 2: Progressive Loading (6-12 weeks)
- Gradual return to weight-bearing
- Range of motion exercises
- Proprioception training
- Ankle strengthening

#### Phase 3: Return to Activity (3-6 months)
- Sport-specific training
- Continue strengthening
- Gradual return to impact activities

### Success Rates
- Small, stable lesions: 45-50% healing with non-operative treatment
- Larger or unstable lesions: Lower success rate

## Patient Education

- Natural history varies
- May take 3-6 months to assess healing
- Some lesions may not heal and require surgery
- Continued symptoms after 3-6 months indicate surgery may be needed

## Follow-up

- Repeat MRI at 3-6 months to assess healing
- If symptoms persist or worsen, consider surgery
- Monitor for development of arthritis
