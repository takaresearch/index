# Ankle Osteoarthritis - Non-Surgical Management

## Clinical Presentation

- Pain with weight-bearing and activity
- Stiffness, especially in the morning
- Decreased range of motion
- History of previous trauma (80% of cases)

## Diagnosis

### Physical Examination
- Decreased dorsiflexion/plantarflexion
- Pain at end range of motion
- Joint line tenderness
- Palpable osteophytes

### Imaging
- Weight-bearing AP, lateral, mortise views
- Look for joint space narrowing, osteophytes, subchondral cysts
- CT for preoperative planning
- MRI if osteochondral lesion suspected

## Non-Surgical Treatment Options

### 1. Activity Modification
- Avoid high-impact activities
- Low-impact exercise (swimming, cycling)
- Weight loss if indicated

### 2. Pharmacological Management
- NSAIDs (oral or topical)
- Acetaminophen
- Intra-articular corticosteroid injection (temporary relief)

### 3. Orthotic Management
- Rocker-bottom shoe modifications
- Ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) for severe cases
- Custom insoles with cushioning

### 4. Physical Therapy
- Range of motion exercises
- Strengthening of surrounding muscles
- Gait training
- Modalities (ice, ultrasound)

## Patient Education

- Natural history: Progressive condition
- Treatment goals: Pain relief, maintain function
- Realistic expectations about activity level
- When to consider surgical options

## Follow-up

- Reassess at 3-6 months
- Monitor symptom progression
- Adjust treatment as needed
