# Ankle Osteoarthritis - Surgical Management

## Indications for Surgery

- Failed conservative management (minimum 3-6 months)
- Significant pain limiting activities of daily living
- Progressive deformity
- Radiographic evidence of advanced arthritis

## Surgical Options

### 1. Ankle Arthroscopy with Debridement
**Indications:**
- Early to moderate arthritis
- Mechanical symptoms (loose bodies, osteophytes)
- Preserved joint space

**Technique:**
- Remove loose bodies and osteophytes
- Synovectomy
- Microfracture for small cartilage defects

**Outcomes:**
- Good short-term pain relief (1-2 years)
- Best for younger, active patients
- May delay need for arthrodesis

### 2. Ankle Arthrodesis (Gold Standard)
**Indications:**
- End-stage ankle arthritis
- Failed previous surgery
- Reliable option for manual laborers

**Technique:**
- Open, arthroscopic, or arthroscopic-assisted
- Remove cartilage, position in neutral/slight valgus
- Fixation: screws, plate, or intramedullary nail

**Positioning:**
- Neutral dorsiflexion
- 5° valgus
- Slight external rotation

**Outcomes:**
- 90-95% fusion rate
- Excellent pain relief
- May develop adjacent joint arthritis over time

### 3. Total Ankle Replacement (TAR)
**Indications:**
- End-stage arthritis
- Adequate bone stock
- No significant deformity
- Patient desires preserved motion

**Contraindications:**
- Active infection
- Avascular necrosis of talus
- Neuropathy
- Severe deformity (>15-20°)

**Technique:**
- Anterior approach
- Bone cuts with alignment guides
- Insert prosthetic components

**Outcomes:**
- Preserves ankle motion
- Good pain relief
- 10-year survival: 70-80%
- Higher revision rate than arthrodesis

## Decision Making

| Factor | Arthrodesis | TAR |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| Age | Any age | <75 years preferred |
| Activity | Manual labor, high-impact | Low-impact activities |
| Adjacent joints | Arthritic | Normal |
| Bone quality | Any | Good |
| Deformity | Any | Minimal (<15°) |

## Postoperative Management

### Arthrodesis
- Non-weight bearing 6-8 weeks
- Gradual weight-bearing with boot
- Full weight-bearing at 12 weeks
- Return to full activity 6 months

### TAR
- Non-weight bearing 2 weeks
- Protected weight-bearing 4-6 weeks
- Gradual return to activity
- Avoid high-impact activities lifelong

## Complications

### Arthrodesis
- Nonunion (5-10%)
- Malunion
- Adjacent joint arthritis
- Hardware irritation

### TAR
- Aseptic loosening
- Subsidence
- Infection
- Wound healing problems
- Instability
- Component migration
