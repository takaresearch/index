# Metatarsalgia - Surgical Management

## Indications for Surgery

**Surgery is RARELY first-line for primary metatarsalgia**

Indications:
- **Failed conservative treatment** (minimum 6-12 months)
- **Identifiable structural pathology**:
  - Hallux valgus causing transfer metatarsalgia
  - Hallux rigidus limiting 1st ray function
  - Rigid hammer/claw toes
  - Plantar plate tear
  - Freiberg's disease
  - Significant metatarsal length discrepancy
  - Pes cavus with excessive forefoot loading
- **Significant functional limitation**
- **Unable to tolerate conservative management**

**Important**: Surgery addresses the **underlying cause**, not just the symptom of forefoot pain.

## Preoperative Assessment

### Identify the Cause
- **Primary vs. secondary metatarsalgia**
- **Associated deformities**: Hallux valgus, hammer toes, cavus foot
- **Specific pathology**: Plantar plate tear, Freiberg's disease
- **Biomechanical factors**: Gastrocnemius contracture, metatarsal length

### Radiographic Assessment
- Weight-bearing X-rays
- **Metatarsal parabola**: Normal cascade of decreasing length from 1-5
- **Relative metatarsal lengths**
- **Associated deformities** (bunion, pes cavus)
- **Freiberg's disease** (flattening, sclerosis of MT head)

### Advanced Imaging
- **MRI**: Plantar plate tear, stress fracture, soft tissue pathology
- **CT**: Bone detail if needed

### Patient Selection
- Realistic expectations
- Understanding that pain may not completely resolve
- Willing to continue orthotic use postoperatively

## Surgical Options

### 1. Address Associated Deformities (Most Common)

#### Hallux Valgus Correction
- **If bunion present**: Correcting bunion often relieves transfer metatarsalgia
- Restore 1st ray weight-bearing
- Procedure depends on bunion severity (see Hallux Valgus section)

#### Hallux Rigidus Treatment
- **If 1st MTP arthritis**: Cheilectomy or arthrodesis
- Restore 1st ray push-off
- Reduces load on lesser metatarsals

#### Hammer/Claw Toe Correction
- **Flexible**: PIPJ arthroplasty, flexor-to-extensor transfer
- **Rigid**: PIPJ arthrodesis
- Reduces pressure under MT heads

#### Gastrocnemius Recession
- If gastrocnemius contracture (>10° equinus)
- Decreases forefoot pressure
- Can be combined with other procedures

### 2. Metatarsal Osteotomies (For Primary Metatarsalgia)

**Indications:**
- Metatarsal length discrepancy
- Prominent MT head
- Failed conservative treatment without other deformity

#### Weil Osteotomy (Most Common)
**Technique:**
- Dorsal longitudinal incision
- Oblique osteotomy parallel to weightbearing surface
- Slide MT head proximally (shortens MT)
- Fix with screw

**Outcomes:**
- **Success**: 70-85%
- **Complications**: Stiffness (20-40%), floating toe, recurrence

**Advantages:**
- Reliable shortening
- Stable fixation

**Disadvantages:**
- High stiffness rate
- Transfer metatarsalgia to adjacent MT (if too much shortening)
- Floating toe deformity

#### Distal MT Osteotomy (Dorsiflexion)
- Elevate MT head (plantarflex distal fragment)
- Offloads pressure
- Less commonly done than Weil

#### BRT (Bösch) Osteotomy
- Distal oblique osteotomy
- Shortens and elevates MT head
- Alternative to Weil

### 3. Plantar Plate Repair

**Indications:**
- MTP instability
- Positive drawer test
- MRI confirmation of tear

**Technique:**
- Dorsal or plantar approach
- Reattach plantar plate to base of proximal phalanx
- Often combined with Weil osteotomy
- May need K-wire temporary fixation

**Outcomes:**
- 70-85% good to excellent results
- Improved stability

### 4. Freiberg's Disease Treatment

**Options:**
- **Early (Stage I-II)**: Debridement, drilling, Weil osteotomy
- **Advanced (Stage III-IV)**: Osteochondral grafting, MT head resection, interpositional arthroplasty

**Technique depends on stage** (see specific Freiberg's protocols)

### 5. Partial MT Head Resection (Rarely Done)

**Technique:**
- Resect plantar condyles of MT head

**Disadvantages:**
- Destabilizes joint
- High complication rate
- Generally avoided

### 6. Pes Cavus Correction

**If severe pes cavus with excessive forefoot loading:**
- **Calcaneal osteotomy**: Dorsiflexion/lateralizing
- **1st MT dorsiflexion osteotomy**
- **Plantar fascia release**
- Complex reconstruction (see Pes Cavus section)

## Surgical Principles

### Which Metatarsals to Operate On
- Typically 2nd and/or 3rd MT most symptomatic
- Restore metatarsal parabola (cascade)
- Avoid creating transfer metatarsalgia

### Amount of Shortening (Weil Osteotomy)
- Usually 3-5mm
- Too much → transfer metatarsalgia, floating toe
- Too little → persistent pain
- Consider 1-2mm less shortening than preoperatively planned

### Avoid Over-Treatment
- Don't shorten multiple metatarsals excessively
- Risk of transfer lesion or generalized forefoot pain

## Postoperative Protocol

### Isolated Weil Osteotomy
**Weeks 0-2:**
- Surgical shoe with stiff sole
- Heel or midfoot weight-bearing
- Avoid direct forefoot pressure
- Elevation, ice

**Weeks 2-6:**
- Continue surgical shoe
- Progressive weight-bearing
- Toe ROM exercises (combat stiffness)

**Weeks 6-8:**
- Transition to wide, stiff-soled shoe
- Full weight-bearing

**Months 3-6:**
- Return to normal activities
- Continue orthotic use

### With Bunion/Hammer Toe Correction
- Follow protocol for primary procedure
- Usually more restrictive initially

### With Plantar Plate Repair
**Weeks 0-6:**
- Surgical shoe or CAM boot
- Non- or protected weight-bearing
- K-wire if placed (remove at 4-6 weeks)

**Weeks 6-12:**
- Progressive weight-bearing
- ROM exercises

## Complications

### Weil Osteotomy Specific
- **Stiffness** (20-40%): Most common complication
  - Early ROM exercises critical
  - May be permanent
  
- **Floating toe** (5-15%): Toe doesn't contact ground
  - Due to over-shortening or extensor tightness
  - Functional but cosmetic issue
  
- **Transfer metatarsalgia** (5-10%): Pain shifts to adjacent MT
  - Due to over-shortening
  
- **Recurrence** (10-15%)
- **Nonunion** (rare, <5%)
- **Malunion**

### General Complications
- Infection (2-5%)
- Wound healing problems
- Nerve injury (numbness)
- Persistent pain despite surgery (10-20%)
- Scar tissue
- Complex regional pain syndrome (rare)

## Outcomes

### By Procedure
| Procedure | Success Rate | Satisfaction | Complications |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| Bunion correction (for transfer metatarsalgia) | 80-90% | 85% | Specific to bunion surgery |
| Weil osteotomy | 70-85% | 70-80% | Stiffness 20-40%, floating toe 5-15% |
| Hammer toe correction | 75-90% | 80% | Specific to procedure |
| Plantar plate repair | 70-85% | 75% | Stiffness, recurrence |
| Gastrocnemius recession | 70-80% | 75% | Sural nerve injury, weakness |

### General Outcomes
- **Patient satisfaction**: 70-85%
- **Pain improvement**: Most improve, but complete resolution uncommon
- **Orthotic use**: Often still needed postoperatively
- **Return to activity**: 3-6 months

## Key Surgical Principles

1. **Surgery addresses the cause**, not just the symptom
2. **Most commonly**: Correct associated deformities (bunion, hammer toes)
3. **Isolated metatarsal osteotomy**: Reserved for structural abnormality
4. **Weil osteotomy**: Reliable but high stiffness rate
5. **Don't over-shorten**: Risk of transfer metatarsalgia, floating toe
6. **Early ROM exercises**: Critical to prevent stiffness
7. **Set realistic expectations**: May not completely resolve pain
8. **Orthotics often still needed** postoperatively

## Revision Surgery

### Indications
- Recurrence
- Transfer metatarsalgia
- Floating toe (if symptomatic)
- Malunion/nonunion
- Persistent pain

### Options
- Revision osteotomy
- Correct adjacent metatarsals
- Address missed pathology
- Arthrodesis (salvage)

### Outcomes
- Less predictable than primary surgery
- 50-70% success rate

## Special Considerations

### Multiple MT Involvement
- May need to address multiple metatarsals
- Higher risk of complications
- More prolonged recovery

### Older Patients
- Consider less aggressive surgery
- Continue orthotic management
- Surgery if severe disability only

### Athletes
- May need surgery earlier if competitive
- Return to sports 4-6 months
- May not return to pre-injury level

### Rheumatoid Arthritis
- Pan-MT head involvement common
- May need more extensive surgery
- Resection arthroplasty or arthrodesis
- Address 1st ray (bunion, hallux rigidus) simultaneously

## Key Points

1. **Surgery for metatarsalgia** primarily addresses **underlying cause**, not isolated forefoot pain
2. **Most common surgeries**: Bunion correction, hammer toe correction (for secondary metatarsalgia)
3. **Weil osteotomy** for primary metatarsalgia or metatarsal length discrepancy
4. **High stiffness rate** with Weil (20-40%) - early ROM critical
5. **Set realistic expectations**: Complete pain resolution uncommon
6. **Orthotics often needed** even after surgery
7. **Success rate**: 70-85% overall, depends on cause
8. **Consider surgery only after** 6-12 months failed conservative treatment
