# Metatarsalgia - Non-Surgical Management

## Clinical Presentation

- **Plantar forefoot pain** under metatarsal heads
- **Burning, aching, or sharp pain**
- **Worse with**: Weight-bearing, walking barefoot, thin-soled shoes
- **Better with**: Rest, shoe removal, massage
- **Calluses** under metatarsal heads
- **Typically affects** 2nd and 3rd metatarsals most commonly

## Definition and Etiology

**Metatarsalgia** = Non-specific term for pain under metatarsal heads

### Causes (Not a single diagnosis)

#### 1. Mechanical Overload
- **Altered weight distribution**: Excessive pressure on metatarsal heads
- **Biomechanical factors**:
  - Pes cavus (high arch) - increased forefoot loading
  - Short 1st metatarsal - transfers load to 2nd MT
  - Long lesser metatarsals
  - Hallux valgus - loss of 1st ray weight-bearing
  - Hallux rigidus - loss of 1st MTP push-off
  - Tight gastrocnemius - increases forefoot pressure
  
#### 2. Anatomic Factors
- **Fat pad atrophy** (aging, steroid injections)
- **Prominent metatarsal heads**
- **Metatarsal declination angle**

#### 3. Pathologic Conditions
- **Freiberg's disease** (2nd MT head osteonecrosis)
- **MTP synovitis/capsulitis**
- **Plantar plate tear**
- **Stress fracture**
- **Sesamoiditis** (1st MT)
- **Morton's neuroma** (interspace, not MT head)

#### 4. Footwear
- **High heels** - shift weight forward
- **Thin soles** - inadequate cushioning
- **Narrow toe box** - compresses forefoot

#### 5. Sports/Activities
- **High-impact activities**: Running, jumping
- **Sports with forefoot loading**: Ballet, basketball, tennis

## Diagnosis

### Clinical History
- Pain location (which metatarsal heads)
- Footwear habits
- Activity level
- Associated deformities (bunion, hammer toes)
- Previous treatments

### Physical Examination
- **Calluses**: Indicate pressure points
- **Point tenderness**: Directly over MT heads (plantar)
- **Metatarsal squeeze test**: Compressing MT heads together → pain
- **Gastrocnemius tightness**: Silfverskiöld test (<10° dorsiflexion with knee extended)
- **Assess for**:
  - Hallux valgus
  - Hammer/claw toes
  - Pes cavus
  - Fat pad atrophy
- **MTP stability**: Drawer test for plantar plate integrity
- **Differentiate from Morton's neuroma**: Interspace tenderness (neuroma) vs. MT head tenderness (metatarsalgia)

### Imaging
- **Weight-bearing AP and Lateral X-rays**:
  - Assess metatarsal length
  - Look for stress fracture
  - Freiberg's disease (flattening, sclerosis of MT head)
  - MTP arthritis
  - Assess alignment (pes cavus, hallux valgus)
  
- **MRI**: If diagnosis uncertain
  - Stress fracture
  - Osteonecrosis
  - Plantar plate tear
  - Soft tissue pathology

## Classification by Etiology

- **Primary metatarsalgia**: Mechanical overload without specific pathology
- **Secondary metatarsalgia**: Due to specific condition (Freiberg's, plantar plate tear, etc.)

## Non-Surgical Treatment

### Success Rate
- **70-90%** improve with conservative treatment
- Best results with mechanical causes

### Treatment Options

#### 1. Footwear Modification (Most Important)
- **Cushioned, thick soles**: Shock absorption
- **Rocker-bottom sole**: Reduces forefoot pressure
- **Wide toe box**: Reduce compression
- **Low heel height**: <2 inches
- **Stiff sole**: Limit MTP motion (if associated hammer toes)
- Avoid: High heels, thin-soled shoes, narrow toe box

#### 2. Orthotic Management
- **Metatarsal pad**: Place proximal to painful MT heads
  - Offloads pressure from MT heads
  - **Critical**: Positioning must be proximal to MT heads, not under them
  
- **Cushioned insoles**: Shock absorption
- **Arch support**: If pes cavus or flatfoot
- **Dancer's pad**: Cutout under painful MT heads with pad proximal
- **Custom orthotics**: Address biomechanical factors

#### 3. Activity Modification
- Reduce high-impact activities
- Cross-training: Swimming, cycling (low forefoot impact)
- Avoid barefoot walking
- Gradual return to activity

#### 4. Stretching
- **Gastrocnemius-soleus stretching**: Critical if tight
  - Decrease forefoot pressure
  - 3 sets of 30 seconds, 2-3x daily
  
- **Plantar fascia stretching**

#### 5. Strengthening
- Intrinsic foot muscle strengthening
- Toe curls, marble pickup
- Improve shock absorption

#### 6. Pharmacological Management
- **NSAIDs**: Oral or topical
- **Ice**: After activity

#### 7. Physical Therapy
- Stretching program
- Strengthening
- Gait training
- Modalities (ultrasound, iontophoresis)

#### 8. Injection Therapy (Use Cautiously)
- **Corticosteroid**: May provide temporary relief
- **Risk**: Fat pad atrophy (worsens condition long-term)
- **Generally avoided** unless severe acute inflammation

### Weight Loss
- Reduces forefoot pressure
- Important if BMI elevated

## Treatment Protocol

**Phase 1 (0-6 weeks):**
- Footwear modification
- Metatarsal pad
- Gastrocnemius stretching
- Activity modification
- NSAIDs

**Phase 2 (6-12 weeks):**
- Continue above
- Add physical therapy if not improving
- Custom orthotics if biomechanical factors

**Phase 3 (3-6 months):**
- If no improvement: Re-evaluate for specific pathology
- Consider MRI
- Surgical consultation if refractory

## Address Underlying Causes

### Associated Conditions to Treat
- **Hallux valgus**: Consider bunion surgery
- **Hallux rigidus**: Treat with cheilectomy or arthrodesis
- **Hammer toes**: Flexible: strapping; Rigid: surgery
- **Gastrocnemius contracture**: Stretching, consider recession if severe
- **Pes cavus**: Orthotics, consider osteotomy if severe

## Patient Education

### Key Points
- **Most cases improve** with footwear and orthotics
- **Metatarsal pad positioning** is critical (proximal to MT heads)
- **Avoid corticosteroid injections** (risk of fat pad atrophy)
- **Gastrocnemius stretching** very important
- **Lifelong footwear modifications** may be needed
- **Address associated deformities** (bunion, hammer toes)

### When to Consider Surgery
- Failed conservative treatment (minimum 3-6 months)
- Identifiable pathology (plantar plate tear, Freiberg's, severe hammer toes)
- Significant functional limitation
- Unable to modify footwear adequately

## Follow-up
- Reassess at 6 weeks
- Ensure proper orthotic positioning
- If no improvement at 3 months, consider MRI
- Surgical consultation if refractory at 6 months

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Morton's neuroma**: Interspace pain, not MT head
- **Stress fracture**: Point tenderness over MT shaft
- **Freiberg's disease**: 2nd MT head osteonecrosis (X-ray)
- **Plantar plate tear**: MTP instability, positive drawer test
- **Sesamoiditis**: Under 1st MT, not lesser MTs
- **MTP synovitis**: Joint effusion, pain with MTP motion
- **Tarsal tunnel syndrome**: Medial ankle, burning, Tinel's sign

## Special Considerations

### Athletes
- High-impact sports exacerbate
- May need activity modification
- Custom sport-specific orthotics
- Consider taping for competitions

### Ballet Dancers
- Extreme forefoot loading
- Often need specialized orthotics or padding
- May need to modify technique

### Fat Pad Atrophy
- More common in elderly
- Prior corticosteroid injections
- Very difficult to treat
- Cushioned shoes and padding critical
- Consider injectable filler (off-label, limited evidence)

### Diabetes/Neuropathy
- May not feel pain until severe
- High risk of ulceration
- Aggressive padding and footwear modification
- Avoid injections

## Key Points

1. **Metatarsalgia** is a symptom, not a diagnosis - find the cause
2. **Footwear modification** is the most effective treatment
3. **Metatarsal pad** must be positioned proximal to MT heads
4. **Gastrocnemius stretching** reduces forefoot pressure
5. **Avoid steroid injections** (risk of fat pad atrophy)
6. **70-90% improve** with conservative treatment
7. **Address associated deformities** (bunion, hammer toes, pes cavus)
8. **Consider MRI** if not improving to rule out specific pathology
