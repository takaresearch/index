# Morton's Neuroma - Surgical Management

## Indications for Surgery

- **Failed conservative treatment** (minimum 3-6 months)
- **Significant pain** limiting activities of daily living
- **Failed corticosteroid injections** (at least 1-2 attempts)
- **Progressive symptoms**
- **Unable to modify footwear** adequately
- **Diagnostic nerve block provides relief** (confirms diagnosis)

## Preoperative Considerations

### Confirm Diagnosis
- **Diagnostic nerve block**: Should provide significant relief
  - If no relief → reconsider diagnosis
- Rule out alternative diagnoses (metatarsalgia, Freiberg's, MTP synovitis)

### Patient Selection
- Realistic expectations
- Willing to comply with postoperative restrictions
- Appropriate footwear expectations

### Imaging
- Weight-bearing X-rays to rule out other pathology
- MRI or ultrasound may help confirm neuroma and size

## Surgical Options

### 1. Neurectomy (Excision) - Gold Standard

#### Indications
- Standard treatment for refractory Morton's neuroma
- Most predictable results

#### Approach Options

**A. Dorsal Approach (Most Common)**
- **Advantages:**
  - Better visualization
  - Can excise nerve more proximally
  - Avoids plantar scar (no weight-bearing pain from scar)
  - Less risk of plantar fat pad injury
  
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Must release deep transverse metatarsal ligament
  - Slightly longer dissection

**Technique:**
- Longitudinal incision between metatarsals (dorsal)
- Retract extensor tendons
- Divide deep transverse metatarsal ligament
- Identify and trace nerve proximally
- Excise neuroma with 1-2 cm of normal nerve proximally
- Leave nerve end in intermetatarsal space (not subcutaneous)

**B. Plantar Approach**
- **Advantages:**
  - Direct access to neuroma
  - Don't need to release ligament
  
- **Disadvantages:**
  - **Plantar scar**: Risk of painful scar with weight-bearing
  - Less popular for this reason
  
**Technique:**
- Transverse or longitudinal incision between MT heads (plantar)
- Identify and excise neuroma
- Ensure adequate proximal excision

**Preferred:** Most surgeons favor **dorsal approach** due to avoiding plantar scar.

#### Outcomes
- **Success (good to excellent)**: 75-90%
- **Symptom relief**: 80-85%
- **Recurrence/persistent pain**: 10-25%
- **Permanent numbness**: 100% (expected, usually not bothersome)
- **Painful stump neuroma**: 5-10%
- **Return to activity**: 6-12 weeks

### 2. Nerve Decompression (Neurolysis)

#### Indications
- Desire to preserve sensation
- Patient preference to avoid numbness
- Early/mild neuromas

#### Technique
- Release deep transverse metatarsal ligament only
- Decompress nerve without excising
- May combine with metatarsal osteotomy if excessive weight-bearing

#### Outcomes
- **Less predictable** than neurectomy
- **Success**: 50-70%
- **Preserves sensation** (advantage)
- **Higher recurrence rate** than excision

#### Disadvantages
- Less reliable pain relief
- May need later neurectomy

**Generally less favored** than neurectomy due to lower success rate.

### 3. Cryoablation

#### Indications
- Alternative to neurectomy
- Minimally invasive option

#### Technique
- Percutaneous or open approach
- Freeze nerve with cryoprobe (-50 to -70°C)
- Causes Wallerian degeneration

#### Outcomes
- **Success**: 60-80% (variable in literature)
- **Less invasive**
- **May require repeat treatment**
- Limited long-term data

### 4. Radiofrequency Ablation

#### Technique
- Heat ablation of nerve
- Can be done percutaneously

#### Outcomes
- Limited evidence
- Not widely used

## Decision Making: Neurectomy vs. Decompression

| Factor | Neurectomy | Decompression |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Success rate** | 75-90% | 50-70% |
| **Predictability** | High | Lower |
| **Sensation** | Permanent numbness | Preserved |
| **Recurrence** | Lower | Higher |
| **Revision if fails** | Difficult | Convert to neurectomy |
| **Recommendation** | **Gold standard** | Alternative option |

**Most surgeons favor neurectomy** due to higher success rate and predictability.

## Postoperative Protocol

### Neurectomy (Dorsal Approach)
**Weeks 0-2:**
- Surgical shoe or CAM boot
- Weight-bearing as tolerated
- Elevation, ice
- Dressing changes

**Weeks 2-4:**
- Progress to stiff-soled shoe
- Increase activity
- Sutures removed at 2 weeks

**Weeks 4-6:**
- Transition to regular shoe (wide toe box)
- Avoid narrow shoes, high heels

**Weeks 6-12:**
- Gradual return to activities
- Full return to activity 8-12 weeks

### Plantar Approach
- Similar protocol
- May limit weight-bearing more initially (protect incision)
- Scar massage after healing

## Complications

### Intraoperative
- Injury to adjacent structures (digital arteries, nerves)
- Incomplete excision

### Early Postoperative
- Wound healing problems (3-5%)
- Infection (1-2%)
- Hematoma

### Late Postoperative
- **Persistent pain** (10-20%):
  - Incorrect diagnosis
  - Incomplete excision
  - Adjacent neuroma (different interspace)
  - Stump neuroma
  
- **Permanent numbness** (100%, expected):
  - Adjacent toes (e.g., 3rd and 4th toes for 3rd interspace)
  - Usually not bothersome
  - Counsel preoperatively
  
- **Stump neuroma** (5-10%):
  - Painful neuroma at proximal cut end
  - May require revision surgery
  
- **Plantar scar pain** (10-20% if plantar approach):
  - Painful with weight-bearing
  - Reason to favor dorsal approach
  
- **Transfer metatarsalgia** (5%):
  - If ligament released, metatarsals may splay
  
- **Recurrence** (5-15%)

## Revision Surgery

### Indications
- Persistent or recurrent pain after neurectomy
- Stump neuroma
- Missed additional neuroma

### Workup
- Confirm diagnosis with nerve block
- MRI or ultrasound to identify stump neuroma
- Rule out other causes (stress fracture, metatarsalgia)

### Options
- **Re-excision with proximal dissection**:
  - Trace nerve more proximally
  - Excise farther proximal to get beyond scar tissue
  - Bury nerve stump in muscle (interosseous)
  
- **Neuromas buried in bone**: Limited evidence
- **Targeted muscle reinnervation**: Emerging technique
- **Nerve capping devices**: Limited evidence

### Outcomes
- Less predictable than primary surgery
- 50-70% success rate

## Outcomes by Approach

| Approach | Success Rate | Numbness | Plantar Scar | Recurrence |
|----------|--------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| Dorsal neurectomy | 75-90% | Yes (expected) | No | 10-15% |
| Plantar neurectomy | 70-85% | Yes (expected) | Yes (risk) | 10-15% |
| Decompression | 50-70% | No | No | 20-30% |
| Cryoablation | 60-80% | Variable | No | Variable |

## Key Surgical Principles

1. **Dorsal approach preferred**: Avoids plantar scar
2. **Adequate proximal excision**: Get 1-2 cm of normal nerve
3. **Confirm diagnosis preoperatively**: Nerve block should provide relief
4. **Neurectomy > Decompression**: Higher success rate
5. **Counsel about numbness**: Permanent, usually not bothersome
6. **Leave nerve stump deep**: Not subcutaneous (avoid painful stump)
7. **Multiple neuromas**: Address all symptomatic interspaces

## Special Considerations

### Multiple Neuromas
- Can address multiple interspaces simultaneously
- Higher recurrence rate
- More extensive numbness
- Counsel patients appropriately

### Failed Prior Surgery
- Stump neuroma vs. incorrect diagnosis
- Diagnostic nerve block critical
- Revision surgery less predictable

### Athletes
- Return to sports 8-12 weeks
- Numbness usually not functionally significant
- High success rate with surgery

## Patient Counseling

### Expectations
- **Pain relief**: 80-85% good to excellent
- **Numbness**: Permanent, expected (between affected toes)
- **Return to activity**: 8-12 weeks
- **Footwear**: Still need to avoid very narrow shoes, high heels
- **Recurrence**: 10-15% may have persistent symptoms

### Decision Making
- Surgery if failed 3-6 months conservative treatment
- High success rate (75-90%)
- Numbness is trade-off for pain relief
- Most patients satisfied despite numbness

## Key Points

1. **Neurectomy (dorsal approach)** is gold standard
2. **75-90% success rate** with neurectomy
3. **Permanent numbness** is expected and usually acceptable
4. **Dorsal approach** preferred over plantar (avoids weight-bearing scar)
5. **Adequate proximal excision** reduces stump neuroma risk
6. **Decompression** has lower success rate, less predictable
7. **Confirm diagnosis** with nerve block before surgery
8. **Most patients satisfied** despite permanent numbness
