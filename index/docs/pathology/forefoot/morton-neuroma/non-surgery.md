# Morton's Neuroma - Non-Surgical Management

## Clinical Presentation

- **Sharp, burning pain** in forefoot, typically 3rd-4th interspace
- **Radiates to toes** (typically 3rd and 4th toes)
- **Numbness/tingling** in adjacent toes
- **Worse with**: Tight shoes, high heels, prolonged standing
- **Better with**: Shoe removal, foot massage
- **"Walking on a pebble" sensation**
- **Intermittent symptoms** initially, may become constant

## Anatomy and Pathophysiology

- **Intermetatarsal (Morton's) Neuroma**: Not a true neuroma, but perineural fibrosis
- **Location**: Most common in 3rd interspace (3rd-4th web space), also 2nd interspace
- **Etiology**: Repetitive compression of digital nerve under transverse metatarsal ligament
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Tight, narrow shoes
  - High heels (>2 inches)
  - Repetitive forefoot loading
  - Foot deformities (bunion, hammer toes, flatfoot)
  - Hypermobility of metatarsals

## Diagnosis

### Clinical History
- **Pain location**: Between metatarsals, radiating to toes
- **Shoe type**: Worse in tight or high-heeled shoes
- **Activity**: Worse with walking, standing
- **Relief**: Removing shoes, massage

### Physical Examination
- **Mulder's Click**:
  - Squeeze metatarsals together with one hand
  - Compress interspace with other hand
  - Palpable "click" with pain reproduction = positive
  
- **Tenderness**: Plantar interspace (not metatarsal head)
- **Numbness**: Adjacent sides of affected toes
- **Metatarsal squeeze test**: Pain with medial-lateral compression
- **Toe spread test**: Unable to abduct affected toes apart
- **Assess for**:
  - Bunion, hammer toes (contribute to narrow toe box)
  - Flatfoot deformity
  - Calluses (metatarsalgia)

### Imaging
- **X-ray** (Weight-bearing AP and lateral):
  - Rule out fracture, arthritis, Freiberg's disease
  - Usually normal in Morton's neuroma
  
- **Ultrasound**:
  - Can visualize neuroma (>5mm suggestive)
  - Operator-dependent
  - Good sensitivity/specificity
  
- **MRI**:
  - High sensitivity for neuroma
  - Useful if diagnosis uncertain
  - Expense usually not warranted

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Metatarsalgia**: Pain at metatarsal heads, not interspace
- **Stress fracture**: Point tenderness over MT shaft
- **Freiberg's disease**: 2nd MT head osteonecrosis (visible on X-ray)
- **MTP synovitis or capsulitis**
- **Intermetatarsal bursitis**
- **Tarsal tunnel syndrome**: Medial ankle symptoms, Tinel's sign
- **Plantar plate tear**: Instability, drawer test positive

## Non-Surgical Treatment

### Success Rate
- **50-80%** improve with conservative treatment
- Better results if symptoms <6 months

### Treatment Options

#### 1. Footwear Modification (Most Important)
- **Wide toe box**: Reduce compression
- **Low heel height**: <2 inches, reduces forefoot pressure
- **Soft, cushioned sole**: Shock absorption
- **Lace-up shoes**: Better adjustability
- **Avoid**: Narrow, pointed toe shoes; high heels

#### 2. Orthotic Management
- **Metatarsal pad**: Place proximal to metatarsal heads
  - Spreads metatarsals apart
  - Reduces compression on nerve
  - **Critical**: Must be positioned correctly (proximal to MT heads)
  
- **Cushioned insoles**: Shock absorption
- **Custom orthotics**: If biomechanical abnormalities (flatfoot)

#### 3. Activity Modification
- Reduce high-impact activities
- Avoid prolonged standing
- Cross-training (swimming, cycling)

#### 4. Pharmacological Management
- **NSAIDs**: Oral or topical
- **Neuropathic pain medications** (if refractory):
  - Gabapentin
  - Pregabalin
  - Limited evidence

#### 5. Injection Therapy

**Corticosteroid Injection:**
- Inject into interspace (plantar or dorsal approach)
- **Success**: 30-50% long-term relief
- Can repeat up to 2-3 times
- **Risks**: Fat pad atrophy (plantar approach), skin depigmentation

**Alcohol Sclerosing Injections:**
- Series of 4-7 injections (4% alcohol)
- Ablates nerve
- **Success**: 60-90% in some studies
- Less invasive than surgery
- Not widely available

**Technique:**
- Dorsal approach preferred (avoid fat pad)
- 23-25 gauge needle
- 1-2 mL mixture (steroid + lidocaine)

### Treatment Protocol

**Phase 1 (0-6 weeks):**
- Footwear modification
- Metatarsal pad
- NSAIDs

**Phase 2 (6-12 weeks):**
- If no improvement: Corticosteroid injection
- Continue footwear/orthotic modifications

**Phase 3 (3-6 months):**
- If no improvement: Consider alcohol injections (if available)
- Or proceed to surgery

## Patient Education

### Key Points
- **Footwear is critical**: Avoid narrow, high-heeled shoes lifelong
- **Metatarsal pad positioning**: Must be proximal to metatarsal heads
- **Injections**: Temporary relief, not curative
- **Surgery**: Consider if no improvement after 3-6 months
- **Recurrence**: Can occur even after treatment
- **Natural history**: May worsen without treatment

### What to Avoid
- High heels >2 inches
- Tight, narrow toe box shoes
- Prolonged barefoot walking (lack of cushioning)
- High-impact activities without proper footwear

## When to Consider Surgery

- **Failed conservative treatment** (minimum 3-6 months)
- **Significant pain** limiting activities
- **Progressive symptoms**
- **Inability to modify footwear adequately** (occupation)
- **Multiple failed injections**

## Follow-up

- Reassess at 6 weeks after starting treatment
- If no improvement, consider injection
- Reassess 3-6 months after injection
- Discuss surgery if conservative treatment fails

## Special Considerations

### Multiple Neuromas
- May have neuromas in multiple interspaces
- Less responsive to conservative treatment
- Higher failure rate with surgery

### Occupation-Related
- Jobs requiring narrow dress shoes (flight attendants, servers)
- May need earlier surgical intervention

### Athletes
- High-impact sports may exacerbate
- Adequate footwear critical
- May need activity modification

## Key Points

1. **Footwear modification** is the most important non-surgical treatment
2. **Wide toe box, low heels** are essential
3. **Metatarsal pad** must be positioned correctly (proximal to MT heads)
4. **Injections** provide relief in 30-50%, but often temporary
5. **50-80% improve** with conservative treatment
6. **Better results** if symptoms <6 months
7. **Surgery** if failed conservative treatment for 3-6 months
