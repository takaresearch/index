# Hallux Valgus - Surgical Management

## Indications for Surgery

- **Failed conservative treatment** (minimum 3-6 months)
- **Significant pain** limiting activities of daily living
- **Difficulty with shoe wear**
- **Progressive deformity**
- **Transfer metatarsalgia**
- **Associated deformities** (crossover 2nd toe)

**NOT indicated for:**
- Cosmetic reasons alone
- Asymptomatic bunions
- Unrealistic patient expectations

## Preoperative Assessment

### Patient Factors
- **Age**: Consider skeletal maturity in adolescents
- **Activity level and goals**
- **Medical comorbidities**: Diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, smoking
- **Realistic expectations**
- **Shoe wear goals**

### Deformity Assessment
- **Severity**: Mild, moderate, severe (HVA, IMA)
- **DMAA** (distal metatarsal articular angle): >10° = abnormal, may need distal osteotomy or double osteotomy
- **First ray hypermobility**: May need TMT fusion (Lapidus)
- **Sesamoid subluxation**: Assess degree
- **Arthritis**: MTP arthrodesis if severe
- **Associated flatfoot**: Address if significant
- **Lesser toe deformities**: Often need correction

## Surgical Procedures by Deformity Severity

### Mild Deformity (HVA 15-20°, IMA 9-11°)

**Distal Soft Tissue Procedure + Distal Metatarsal Osteotomy**

**1. Chevron Osteotomy**
- V-shaped osteotomy through distal MT head
- Lateral displacement of capital fragment
- Fix with screw
- Corrects up to 15° HVA, 5° IMA
- **Advantages**: Stable, predictable
- **Disadvantages**: Limited correction

**2. Scarf Osteotomy**
- Z-shaped osteotomy through MT shaft
- Allows translation and rotation
- More versatile than Chevron
- **Advantages**: Greater correction potential
- **Disadvantages**: Technically demanding

### Moderate Deformity (HVA 20-40°, IMA 11-16°)

**Proximal or Diaphyseal Osteotomy + Soft Tissue Procedure**

**1. Proximal Crescentic Osteotomy**
- Curved osteotomy at MT base
- Rotate to correct deformity
- Less stable, needs protection

**2. Proximal Chevron**
- Similar to distal Chevron but at MT base
- Greater correction than distal

**3. Scarf Osteotomy**
- Can also be used for moderate deformities
- Popular in Europe

**4. Lapidus Procedure** (TMT Arthrodesis)
- Fuse 1st TMT joint
- Correct IMA at base
- **Indications:**
  - First ray hypermobility
  - TMT arthritis
  - Severe deformity with flexibility at TMT
- **Advantages**: Addresses hypermobility, durable correction
- **Disadvantages**: Fusion (loss of motion), longer recovery

### Severe Deformity (HVA >40°, IMA >16°)

**Double Osteotomy or Lapidus Procedure**

**1. Lapidus Procedure** (Preferred by many)
- TMT arthrodesis
- Most powerful correction
- Addresses instability

**2. Proximal + Distal Osteotomy**
- Correct at two levels
- Technically challenging
- Risk of AVN (metatarsal head)

### Arthritis at MTP Joint

**MTP Arthrodesis**
- Fuse 1st MTP joint in functional position
- 10-15° dorsiflexion, 10-15° valgus
- Eliminates bunion and arthritis pain
- Loss of MTP motion (affects shoe wear, gait)
- **Outcomes**: Excellent pain relief, high satisfaction

## Soft Tissue Procedures (Usually Combined)

### Medial Capsular Plication
- Tighten medial capsule
- Excise medial eminence

### Lateral Release
- Release adductor hallucis
- Release lateral capsule
- Free lateral sesamoid if needed

### Akin Osteotomy (Proximal Phalanx)
- Closing wedge osteotomy of proximal phalanx
- Corrects interphalangeal deviation
- Often added to metatarsal osteotomy

## Decision Algorithm

```
Severity:
├─ Mild (HVA 15-20°, IMA <11°)
│  └─ Distal osteotomy (Chevron or Scarf)
│
├─ Moderate (HVA 20-40°, IMA 11-16°)
│  ├─ No hypermobility → Proximal osteotomy or Scarf
│  └─ Hypermobility → Lapidus
│
└─ Severe (HVA >40°, IMA >16°)
   └─ Lapidus (preferred) or Double osteotomy

Arthritis at MTP:
└─ MTP Arthrodesis

High DMAA (>10°):
└─ Consider distal soft tissue realignment or double osteotomy
```

## Surgical Techniques

### Distal Soft Tissue Procedure (McBride)
- Medial incision
- Excise medial eminence (don't over-resect)
- Lateral release (through separate incision or same)
- Release adductor, lateral capsule
- Tighten medial capsule

### Chevron Osteotomy
- 60° V-shaped cut through distal MT
- Translate lateral 3-5 mm
- Fix with screw
- Stable construct

### Lapidus Procedure
- Dorsomedial incision over 1st TMT joint
- Remove cartilage at TMT joint
- Reduce IMA
- Fix with plate or screws
- Rigid fixation for fusion

## Postoperative Protocol

### Distal Osteotomies (Chevron)
**Weeks 0-2:**
- Surgical shoe with stiff sole
- Weight-bearing on heel only
- Elevation

**Weeks 2-6:**
- Protected weight-bearing in surgical shoe
- May progress to full weight-bearing in shoe
- ROM exercises (gentle)

**Weeks 6-8:**
- Transition to wide, supportive shoe
- Progressive activity

**Months 3-6:**
- Return to normal shoes (wide toe box)
- Return to activities

### Proximal Osteotomies / Lapidus
**Weeks 0-6:**
- Short leg cast or CAM boot
- Non-weight bearing
- Elevation

**Weeks 6-8:**
- CAM boot, protected weight-bearing
- Check X-rays for healing/fusion

**Weeks 8-12:**
- Progressive weight-bearing
- Transition to shoe

**Months 3-6:**
- Return to regular shoes
- Full activity at 4-6 months

### MTP Arthrodesis
**Weeks 0-6:**
- Short leg cast or CAM boot
- Non-weight bearing

**Weeks 6-8:**
- Protected weight-bearing once fusion evident

**Weeks 8-12:**
- Full weight-bearing
- Transition to shoe

**Months 3-6:**
- Full activity
- Avoid high heels (difficulty with MTP fusion)

## Complications

### Intraoperative
- Neurovascular injury (medial dorsal cutaneous nerve)
- Fracture propagation
- Over/under-correction

### Early Postoperative
- Wound healing problems (5-10%)
- Infection (2-5%)
- Swelling (universal, can last months)
- Stiffness

### Late Postoperative
- **Recurrence** (5-15%)
- **Hallux varus** (overcorrection, 2-5%)
- **Transfer metatarsalgia** (5-10%)
- **Nonunion** (Lapidus: 5%, arthrodesis: 5-10%)
- **Malunion** (poor position)
- **AVN of metatarsal head** (rare, <1%)
- **Persistent pain or stiffness**
- **Numbness** (medial dorsal cutaneous nerve)

## Outcomes by Procedure

| Procedure | Success Rate | Recurrence | Return to Activity | Satisfaction |
|-----------|--------------|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Chevron | 85-90% | 5-10% | 3 months | 85-90% |
| Scarf | 85-95% | 5-10% | 3-4 months | 85-90% |
| Proximal osteotomy | 80-90% | 10-15% | 4-6 months | 80-85% |
| Lapidus | 90-95% | <5% | 4-6 months | 90% |
| MTP arthrodesis | 90-95% | N/A | 4-6 months | 85-90% |

## Key Surgical Principles

1. **Correct all components**: Bony deformity + soft tissue imbalance
2. **Don't over-resect** medial eminence (risk of hallux varus)
3. **Lateral release** essential for moderate-severe deformities
4. **Lapidus for hypermobility**: Don't miss instability
5. **DMAA >10°**: Consider distal realignment or double osteotomy
6. **Arthrodesis for arthritis**: Don't do osteotomy if arthritis present
7. **Address lesser toe deformities**: Often need simultaneous correction
8. **Patient selection**: Realistic expectations, appropriate footwear goals

## Special Considerations

### Adolescent Hallux Valgus
- High recurrence rate (20-30%)
- Defer surgery until skeletal maturity if possible
- Address flatfoot if present

### Rheumatoid Arthritis
- Aggressive deformity, multiple toe involvement
- Often need MTP arthrodesis or resection arthroplasty
- Address lesser toes simultaneously

### Diabetes / Peripheral Vascular Disease
- Higher complication rate
- Assess vascular status preoperatively
- May need non-operative management

## Revision Surgery

### Indications
- Recurrence
- Hallux varus
- Persistent pain
- Malunion/nonunion

### Options
- Revision osteotomy (if young, minimal surgery previously)
- Lapidus if previous distal procedure
- MTP arthrodesis (salvage)

## Key Points

1. **Surgery corrects deformity**, non-operative does not
2. **Match procedure to deformity severity** and patient factors
3. **Lapidus procedure** excellent for moderate-severe deformity and hypermobility
4. **MTP arthrodesis** for arthritis
5. **Realistic expectations**: Swelling lasts months, shoe wear limitations
6. **High patient satisfaction** overall (85-90%)
7. **Not cosmetic surgery**: Done for pain and function
