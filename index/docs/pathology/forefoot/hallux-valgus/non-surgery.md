# Hallux Valgus - Non-Surgical Management

## Clinical Presentation

- Medial prominence at 1st MTP joint ("bunion")
- Lateral deviation of great toe
- Pain over medial eminence from shoe irritation
- Difficulty with shoe wear
- Transfer metatarsalgia (lesser toes)
- Cosmetic concerns

## Classification

### By Deformity Severity (Radiographic)
- **Mild**: HVA 15-20°, IMA 9-11°
- **Moderate**: HVA 20-40°, IMA 11-16°
- **Severe**: HVA >40°, IMA >16°

**Angles:**
- **HVA** (Hallux Valgus Angle): Between 1st metatarsal and proximal phalanx (Normal <15°)
- **IMA** (Intermetatarsal Angle): Between 1st and 2nd metatarsals (Normal <9°)

### Associated Deformities
- **Pronation** of great toe
- **Bunionette** (5th toe)
- **Crossover 2nd toe** deformity
- **Pes planus** (flatfoot)

## Etiology and Risk Factors

- **Footwear**: Narrow toe box, high heels (exacerbating factor)
- **Genetics**: Strong familial predisposition
- **Ligamentous laxity**
- **Inflammatory arthritis** (RA)
- **Neuromuscular conditions**
- **First ray hypermobility**

## Diagnosis

### Physical Examination
- **Alignment**: Measure HVA clinically
- **Medial Eminence**: Bursitis, tenderness
- **Range of Motion**: First MTP joint (assess for rigidus)
- **Pronation**: Great toe pronates with deformity
- **Transfer Metatarsalgia**: Calluses under lesser metatarsals
- **Crossover Deformity**: 2nd toe overlaps great toe
- **First Ray Mobility**: Assess hypermobility
- **Foot Type**: Pes planus often associated

### Imaging
- **Weight-bearing AP and Lateral Foot X-rays** (Essential)
- **Measure:**
  - HVA (hallux valgus angle)
  - IMA (intermetatarsal angle)
  - DMAA (distal metatarsal articular angle): assess articular surface
  - Sesamoid position
- **Assess for:**
  - Arthritis at 1st MTP joint
  - First TMT joint instability
  - Pes planus deformity

## Non-Surgical Treatment

### Indications
- **Mild symptoms**
- **Minimal pain**
- **Primarily cosmetic concerns**
- **Low-demand patients**
- **Patients unwilling to undergo surgery**

### Treatment Goals
- **Pain relief** (not deformity correction)
- **Accommodate deformity**
- **Prevent progression** (uncertain)

### Treatment Options

#### 1. Footwear Modification (Most Important)
- **Wide toe box**: Accommodate deformity
- **Soft uppers**: Reduce pressure on bunion
- **Rocker sole**: Decrease 1st MTP motion
- **Low heel height**: <2 inches
- Avoid narrow, pointy shoes

#### 2. Padding and Orthotics
- **Bunion pads**: Gel or felt over medial eminence
- **Toe spacers**: Between 1st and 2nd toes (limited efficacy)
- **Custom orthotics**: Arch support for flatfoot
- **Bunion splint/night splint**: May provide temporary relief, does NOT correct deformity

#### 3. Pharmacological Management
- **NSAIDs**: For bursitis, inflammation
- **Ice**: After prolonged standing/walking
- **Topical analgesics**

#### 4. Injection Therapy (Limited Role)
- **Corticosteroid**: For acute bursitis over medial eminence
- Temporary relief only
- Do NOT inject into joint (risk of cartilage damage)

### What DOESN'T Work
- **Toe spacers/splints**: Do NOT correct deformity permanently
- **"Bunion correctors"**: Marketing gimmick, no evidence
- **Exercises**: Cannot reverse bony deformity

## Patient Education

### Key Points
- **Non-operative treatment** does NOT correct deformity
- **Goal**: Symptom management, not deformity correction
- **Progression**: May progress over time despite treatment
- **Footwear**: Most important factor for symptom control
- **Surgery**: Only definitive treatment for deformity correction
- **Cosmetic surgery**: Not recommended if asymptomatic
- **Realistic expectations**: Can't "cure" bunion without surgery

### When to Consider Surgery
- **Failed conservative treatment** (3-6 months)
- **Significant pain** limiting activities
- **Difficulty with shoe wear**
- **Progressive deformity**
- **Transfer metatarsalgia**
- **Crossover toe deformity**

## Success Rates
- **Footwear modification**: 70-80% have adequate symptom relief
- **Does NOT prevent progression** of deformity
- **Temporary relief** with padding, NSAIDs

## Follow-up
- Reassess at 3-6 months
- Monitor for progression (serial X-rays if symptomatic progression)
- Discuss surgery if symptoms persist or worsen

## Special Considerations

### Adolescent Hallux Valgus
- Often familial, bilateral
- Conservative treatment preferred until skeletal maturity
- High recurrence rate even with surgery

### Inflammatory Arthritis (RA)
- Aggressive deformity
- Address underlying disease
- Higher surgical complication rate

### Hypermobility/Flatfoot
- Address with arch support
- May need more extensive surgery if operative

## Key Points

1. **Non-operative treatment** provides symptom relief, NOT deformity correction
2. **Wide shoes** are the most effective non-surgical intervention
3. **"Bunion correctors"** and toe spacers do NOT work
4. **Surgery** is the only way to correct deformity
5. **Asymptomatic bunions** do NOT need treatment
6. **Progression** is variable and unpredictable
