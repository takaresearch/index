# Hallux Rigidus - Surgical Management

## Indications for Surgery

- **Failed conservative treatment** (minimum 3-6 months)
- **Significant pain** limiting activities of daily living
- **Progressive deformity and stiffness**
- **Inability to maintain adequate footwear**
- **Grade 2-4 disease** (especially Grade 3-4)

## Preoperative Assessment

### Patient Factors
- **Age and activity level**
- **Functional demands**
- **Shoe wear requirements**
- **Occupation** (effects of fusion vs. arthroplasty)
- **Expectations**: Motion preservation vs. pain relief

### Radiographic Assessment
- **Grade** (0-4): Guides procedure selection
- **Dorsal osteophytes**: Size and location
- **Joint space**: Amount of remaining cartilage
- **Cartilage distribution**: Dorsal vs. plantar/central
- **Sesamoid arthritis**
- **Metatarsal length**: Relative to 2nd MT

## Surgical Options by Grade

### Grade 1-2: Joint-Preserving Procedures

#### 1. Cheilectomy (Dorsal Osteophyte Excision)

**Indications:**
- Grade 1-2 disease
- Dorsal impingement pain
- Preserved joint space (>50%)
- Dorsal/dorsolateral cartilage loss only

**Technique:**
- Dorsal incision
- Excise dorsal 20-30% of metatarsal head
- Remove dorsal osteophytes
- Dorsal capsulectomy
- Decompress joint

**Outcomes:**
- **Success**: 70-90% good to excellent results
- **Pain relief**: 80-90%
- **Increased dorsiflexion**: 20-30°
- **Durability**: 5-10 years average
- **Revision rate**: 20-30% within 10 years

**Advantages:**
- Preserves motion
- Low morbidity
- Quick recovery (6-8 weeks)
- Can convert to arthrodesis later

**Disadvantages:**
- Does not address advanced arthritis
- Temporary solution for many
- May not relieve midrange pain (Grade 4)

#### 2. Cheilectomy + Moberg Osteotomy

**Indications:**
- Grade 2 disease
- Need greater dorsiflexion
- Plantar cartilage preserved

**Technique:**
- Cheilectomy as above
- Dorsal closing wedge osteotomy of proximal phalanx
- Extends hallux (increases functional dorsiflexion)

**Outcomes:**
- Similar to cheilectomy, may provide additional dorsiflexion
- 75-85% good results

### Grade 2-3: Consider Cheilectomy or Arthrodesis

**Decision depends on:**
- Amount of remaining cartilage
- Patient age and activity
- Presence of midrange pain

### Grade 3-4: Arthrodesis or Arthroplasty

#### 1. MTP Arthrodesis (Gold Standard for Advanced Disease)

**Indications:**
- Grade 3-4 disease
- Young, active patients
- Manual laborers
- Revision after failed cheilectomy or arthroplasty

**Technique:**
- Medial or dorsal incision
- Prepare joint surfaces (remove cartilage)
- Position: 10-15° dorsiflexion, 10-15° valgus, neutral rotation
- Fixation: Plate, screws, or combination

**Positioning Critical:**
- **Dorsiflexion**: 10-15° relative to floor when standing
  - Too much: Difficulty walking downhill, IPJ stress
  - Too little: Difficulty with toe-off, shoe wear
- **Valgus**: 10-15° (match contralateral if normal)
- **Rotation**: Neutral (nail points upward)

**Outcomes:**
- **Fusion rate**: 90-95%
- **Pain relief**: 90-95% excellent
- **Satisfaction**: 85-95%
- **Return to activity**: 4-6 months
- **Durability**: Lifelong
- **Complications**: Nonunion (5-10%), malposition, IPJ arthritis

**Advantages:**
- Excellent, predictable pain relief
- Durable solution
- Allows return to high-impact activities
- No implant issues

**Disadvantages:**
- Loss of MTP motion
- Difficulty with certain shoe wear (high heels)
- Stress transfer to IPJ (may develop arthritis)
- Permanent solution (not reversible)

#### 2. Hemi-Arthroplasty (Interposition or Implant)

**Indications:**
- Grade 3-4 disease
- Older, lower-demand patients
- Desire to preserve motion
- Not suitable for high-impact activities

**Types:**
- **Metatarsal head resurfacing** (HemiCAP)
- **Silicone implant** (Historical, high failure rate)
- **Cartiva (SCI)** - Synthetic cartilage implant

**Outcomes:**
- **Variable results**: 60-80% good to excellent
- **Preserves some motion**
- **Less predictable** than arthrodesis
- **Revision rate higher** than arthrodesis

**Advantages:**
- Preserves motion
- Reversible (can convert to arthrodesis)

**Disadvantages:**
- Less predictable outcomes
- Implant-related complications
- Not for high-demand patients
- May require revision

#### 3. Total Joint Replacement (Rare)

**Indications:**
- Very limited
- Older, low-demand patients
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Desire motion preservation

**Outcomes:**
- **High failure rate** (30-50% within 10 years)
- **Loosening, subsidence** common
- Generally NOT recommended

#### 4. Keller Resection Arthroplasty (Salvage Only)

**Technique:**
- Resect proximal phalanx base (30-50%)
- Create fibrous pseudoarthrosis

**Indications:**
- Salvage procedure only
- Elderly, low-demand patients
- Contraindication to arthrodesis

**Outcomes:**
- **Poor push-off strength**
- **Cock-up deformity**
- **Transfer metatarsalgia**
- Generally avoided in modern practice

## Decision Algorithm

```
Grade 1-2 + Preserved cartilage:
└─ Cheilectomy (± Moberg)

Grade 2-3 + Moderate cartilage loss:
├─ Young, active → Cheilectomy
└─ Older, low-demand or midrange pain → Consider arthrodesis

Grade 3-4:
├─ Young, active, high-demand
│  └─ MTP Arthrodesis (Gold Standard)
│
├─ Older, low-demand, want motion
│  └─ Hemi-arthroplasty or Arthrodesis
│
└─ Rheumatoid, very low-demand
   └─ Consider implant arthroplasty

Failed Cheilectomy:
└─ MTP Arthrodesis
```

## Postoperative Protocol

### Cheilectomy
**Weeks 0-2:**
- Surgical shoe
- Weight-bearing as tolerated
- Elevation

**Weeks 2-6:**
- Progress to regular shoe (stiff-soled)
- ROM exercises immediately

**Weeks 6-8:**
- Return to activities

**Months 3-6:**
- Full activities

### MTP Arthrodesis
**Weeks 0-6:**
- Short leg cast or CAM boot
- Non-weight bearing (some protocols allow heel weight-bearing)
- Elevation

**Weeks 6-8:**
- CAM boot, protected weight-bearing
- Check X-rays for fusion progress

**Weeks 8-12:**
- Full weight-bearing in boot
- Progressive activity

**Months 3-6:**

## Complications

### Cheilectomy
- Recurrence (20-30% within 10 years)
- Persistent pain (10-20%)
- Stiffness
- Neurovascular injury
- Progression to arthrodesis needed

### MTP Arthrodesis
- **Nonunion** (5-10%): Most common complication
- **Malposition** (5%): Too much/little dorsiflexion or valgus
- **IPJ arthritis** (10-20% long-term): Stress transfer
- **Hardware irritation** (5-10%)
- **Infection** (2-5%)
- **Persistent pain despite fusion** (rare)

### Arthroplasty
- Implant loosening/subsidence (10-30%)
- Osteolysis (silicone synovitis if silicone)
- Infection (2-5%)
- Stiffness or persistent pain
- Revision surgery needed (15-30%)

## Outcomes by Procedure

| Procedure | Success Rate | Motion | Durability | Patient Satisfaction | Return to Activity |
|-----------|--------------|--------|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Cheilectomy (Grade 1-2) | 70-90% | Improved | 5-10 years | 80-85% | 6-8 weeks |
| MTP Arthrodesis | 90-95% | Lost | Lifelong | 85-95% | 4-6 months |
| Hemi-arthroplasty | 60-80% | Partial | Variable | 70-80% | 3-4 months |

## Key Surgical Principles

1. **Grade determines procedure**: Don't do cheilectomy for Grade 4
2. **MTP arthrodesis** is gold standard for advanced disease (Grade 3-4)
3. **Positioning** in arthrodesis is critical: 10-15° dorsiflexion, 10-15° valgus
4. **Cheilectomy** for early disease (Grade 1-2), allows conversion to arthrodesis later
5. **Arthroplasty** has higher revision rate, less predictable than arthrodesis
6. **Total joint replacement** generally not recommended
7. **Patient selection**: Match procedure to patient demand and expectations

## Revision Surgery

### Failed Cheilectomy
- **Convert to arthrodesis** (most common)
- Outcomes of arthrodesis after cheilectomy are good

### Nonunion after Arthrodesis
- Revision arthrodesis with bone graft
- Ensure proper positioning
- Consider biologic augmentation (BMP)

### Failed Arthroplasty
- **Convert to arthrodesis**
- More technically demanding
- May need bone graft
- Outcomes less predictable than primary arthrodesis

## Special Considerations

### Athletes
- Cheilectomy preferred if early disease (preserve motion)
- Arthrodesis allows return to high-impact sports
- Some elite athletes successfully compete with arthrodesis

### High Heels
- Difficult with arthrodesis (fixed position)
- Counsel patients preoperatively
- Consider arthroplasty if high heel wear essential (though less reliable)

### Bilateral Disease
- Common (up to 80%)
- Stage surgeries 3-6 months apart
- Consider doing less affected side first

## Key Points

1. **Cheilectomy** for early disease (Grade 1-2) with preserved joint space
2. **MTP arthrodesis** is gold standard for advanced disease (Grade 3-4)
3. **Arthrodesis provides excellent pain relief** (90-95%) with predictable outcomes
4. **Arthroplasty** less reliable, higher revision rate
5. **Positioning** in arthrodesis is critical for good outcome
6. **Motion vs. Pain relief**: Arthrodesis sacrifices motion but gives best pain relief
7. **Failed cheilectomy** converts well to arthrodesis
