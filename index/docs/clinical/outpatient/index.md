This section provides structured templates for outpatient consultations, organized by patient type and clinical scenario. Each scenario includes guidance for patient communication, documentation, and presentation.

## Structure

### 1. New Referral
First-time consultations for new patients referred to the foot and ankle service.

- **A. Diagnostic Testing + Non-Surgical Treatment**: Patients requiring investigation with planned conservative management

### 2. Follow-up
Return visits for established patients.

- **A. Test Results + Non-Surgical Treatment**: Reviewing investigations and initiating/continuing conservative care
- **B. Post-Op Acute (Complication Monitoring)**: Early postoperative review (0-6 weeks) focusing on wound healing and complication surveillance
- **C. Post-Op Subacute (Functional Recovery)**: Later postoperative review (6 weeks+) focusing on rehabilitation and functional outcomes

## Format

Each clinical scenario is presented in three formats:

1. **Patient Communication**: Conversational phrases and explanation templates for direct patient interaction
2. **Documentation**: Structured templates for medical records and referral letters
3. **Short Presentation**: Concise format for presenting to colleagues or at handover

## Components

Each format follows the same clinical structure:

- **a. History Taking**: Key questions and information gathering

Diagnosis 
REVIEW 2-A follow up 
Diagnosis
 This is a six-month review following non-surgical management of an Adhilles tendon rupture. (2-A)
 On examination, there is good tendon healing with a thick tendon substance. There is a slight increase in dorsiflextion on the injured side, suggesting some elongation of the tendon. THere is asignificant calf muslce waisiting on the injrued leg. He is able to performe a single stance heel rise.

Plan
 I have advised him to avoid agressive streaching of the tendon to prevent futher elongation and subsequent weakness. (2-A)
 I have recommended he recommence physioto focus on a home exercise program for isolated calf strengthening, specifically single stance heel raises. (2-A)
 We will review him again in three months to assess his progress.

 It was a pleasure seeing X.
