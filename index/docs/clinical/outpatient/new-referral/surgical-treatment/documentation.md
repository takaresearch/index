Main Paragraph

It was a pleasure to see [PATIENT] today for review of persistent ankle symptoms and surgical consultation. [PATIENT] reports ankle pain and instability with recurrent giving-way episodes for the past 18 months, following an inversion injury sustained while playing basketball in March 2024. The ankle "gives way" 2-3 times per week, particularly on uneven ground, causing significant functional limitation and inability to return to sport.

Prior management has included:
- Immobilization in CAM boot for 6 weeks (initial treatment)
- Physiotherapy focusing on proprioception and strengthening for 4 months with partial improvement in strength but persistent instability
- Ankle brace worn for high-risk activities with continued episodes
- Activity modification with avoidance of sport for 12 months

Overall conservative trial: 15 months with insufficient response. [PATIENT] wishes to proceed with operative management after consideration of timing and goals. Primary goal is to return to recreational basketball and hiking without fear of ankle giving way.

On examination, foot and ankle alignment is normal with full range of motion of the ankle and subtalar joint. There is severe lateral ligament laxity on stress testing. Anterior drawer test demonstrates 10mm of anterior translation compared to 3mm on the contralateral side (>7mm difference). Talar tilt test shows 15 degrees of tilt compared to 5 degrees contralaterally. There is subjective sense of anterolateral apprehension with stress. No medial tenderness or instability. Neurovascular examination is intact.

Investigations reviewed:
- Ankle MRI demonstrates a severely attenuated and lax ATFL with complete discontinuity. The CFL is also attenuated and lax. The deltoid ligament is intact but shows some laxity on the deep component. Cartilage surfaces are intact with no osteochondral defect. No significant bone marrow edema. Small amount of joint effusion consistent with chronic synovitis.
- Weight-bearing X-rays show no evidence of arthritis, normal joint space, and good alignment. No bony abnormalities or loose bodies.

Imaging confirms chronic lateral ligament insufficiency with mechanical laxity appropriate for surgical stabilization. Preserved cartilage is favorable for good outcome.

## 4. Impression and Recommendation

**Format**: Summary with surgical indication → Confirmation patient suitable → IC discussion recap → Proceed with plan

**Template**:

**Summary**:
In summary, [PATIENT] has [DIAGNOSIS] with [clear surgical indication based on: failed conservative management / mechanical pathology / functional limitation / progressive disease].

**Surgical Suitability**:
[PATIENT] is suitable for surgical intervention. [Any relevant factors: medical clearance obtained / no contraindications / appropriate expectations / motivated for rehabilitation].

**IC Recap**:
I have discussed the procedure ([SPECIFIC PROCEDURE]) and the specific risks, including [KEY RISKS specific to procedure], as well as the expected recovery pathway and realistic functional goals.

**Plan Forward**:
We will proceed with [PROCEDURE] as outlined. [Next specific steps: scheduling / preoperative workup / timing considerations].

**Alternative if patient considering**:
[PATIENT] would like time to consider the surgical option. We will reassess in [TIMEFRAME] or [PATIENT] will contact the office when ready to proceed.

**Common phrases**:
- has [failed conservative management / mechanical instability / end-stage arthritis]
- is suitable for surgical intervention
- appropriate candidate for | would benefit from
- I have discussed the procedure and risks
- including [specific risks relevant to the procedure]
- expected recovery pathway | realistic functional goals
- We will proceed with | plan to organize | schedule surgery
- will contact the office when ready to proceed

**Example**:

Impression and Recommendation

In summary, [PATIENT] has chronic lateral ankle instability with mechanical laxity, documented both clinically and radiologically. [PATIENT] has failed appropriate conservative management over 15 months including prolonged physiotherapy and bracing, and continues to have recurrent giving-way episodes significantly impacting quality of life and preventing return to desired activities. This represents clear indication for surgical stabilization.

[PATIENT] is an appropriate candidate for surgical intervention: medically fit, non-smoker, motivated for rehabilitation, and has realistic expectations regarding recovery timeline and outcomes. The intact cartilage on MRI is favorable for good long-term outcome.

I believe [PATIENT] would benefit from ankle arthroscopy (to assess and treat any intra-articular pathology such as synovitis or loose bodies) and lateral ligament reconstruction (Broström-Gould procedure, with possible internal brace augmentation depending on intraoperative tissue quality). I have discussed the procedure and the specific risks, including nerve injury (particularly superficial peroneal nerve, with possible temporary neuropraxia or permanent sensory change in 5-10% of cases), recurrent instability (5-10% failure rate requiring revision), infection (2-5%), stiffness, and thromboembolic complications, as well as the expected recovery pathway (6 weeks protected weight-bearing in boot, then 3-6 months progressive rehabilitation before return to sport).

We will proceed with organizing surgery and postoperative rehabilitation as outlined. [PATIENT] will contact the office to arrange surgical scheduling to coordinate with work commitments (aiming for [TIMEFRAME/SEASON]). Preoperative clearance and consent forms will be arranged at that time.

Thank you again for this referral.

Yours sincerely,

Plan
- Plan: Right ankle arthroscopy and lateral ligament reconstruction (Broström-Gould procedure)

- IC (Benefits): improved stability, reduced giving-way episodes, functional improvement, return to sport

- IC (Risks): nerve injury (superficial peroneal nerve), infection (2-5%), stiffness, recurrent instability (5-10%), DVT/PE, incomplete pain relief, anaesthetic risks

- Natural history: untreated instability increases risk of recurrent episodes and may increase risk of cartilage damage and long-term arthritis

- Next steps: [PATIENT] to contact office to arrange scheduling; consent forms and preoperative clearance to be arranged

Main Paragraph

It was a pleasure to see [PATIENT] today for surgical consultation regarding persistent ankle instability. [PATIENT] reports 18 months of ankle instability with recurrent giving-way episodes 2-3 times per week following initial inversion injury. Prior management has included 6 weeks immobilization, 4 months physiotherapy with proprioception training, and ankle bracing, with overall conservative trial of 15 months. [PATIENT] wishes to proceed with operative management to return to basketball and hiking.

On examination, there is severe lateral ligament laxity. Anterior drawer test demonstrates 10mm anterior translation (vs 3mm contralateral). Talar tilt test shows 15 degrees (vs 5 degrees contralateral). Neurovascular examination is intact.

MRI demonstrates complete ATFL and CFL insufficiency with severe attenuation. Cartilage is intact. X-rays show no arthritis.

Impression and Recommendation

In summary, [PATIENT] has chronic lateral ankle instability with mechanical laxity, failed appropriate conservative management, and clear indication for surgical stabilization. I believe [PATIENT] would benefit from ankle arthroscopy and lateral ligament reconstruction. I have discussed the procedure, risks including nerve injury and recurrent instability, and expected recovery. We will proceed with organizing surgery as outlined.

Thank you again for this referral.
