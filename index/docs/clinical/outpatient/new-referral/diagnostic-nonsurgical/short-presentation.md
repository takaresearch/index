# New Referral: Diagnostic + Non-Surgical - Short Presentation

## a. History Taking

**Format**: "[AGE] [SEX] with [DURATION] history of [LOCATION] pain"

**Example**: "45F with 6-month history of bilateral heel pain, worse on first steps in morning, refractory to physiotherapy and orthotics."

**Key Elements**:
- Age, sex
- Duration and location
- Key characteristic (functional limitation)
- Failed treatments

---

## b. Examination

**Format**: "On examination, [key positive findings]. [Key negative findings]."

**Example**: "On examination, tenderness over plantar fascia insertion bilaterally, limited ankle dorsiflexion. Neurovascularly intact, no signs of infection."

**Key Elements**:
- Positive findings (specific anatomical structures)
- Relevant negative findings
- Red flag exclusions

**Imaging Summary**:
**Format**: "Imaging: [X-ray / MRI / CT / Ultrasound] shows [key finding]."

**Example**: "Imaging: Weight-bearing X-rays show preserved joint spaces with minimal spurring. MRI demonstrates Achilles mid-substance degeneration without complete tear."

**Key Elements**:
- Modality used
- Key positive findings
- Important negative findings (e.g., "no fracture," "no complete tear")

---

## c. Impression

**Format**: "[Primary diagnosis]. DDx: [alternatives]."

**Example**: "Chronic bilateral plantar fasciitis. DDx: Baxter's nerve entrapment, calcaneal stress fracture."

**Key Elements**:
- Primary diagnosis with key descriptors (acute/chronic, unilateral/bilateral)
- Top 2-3 differentials

---

## d. Recommendation

**Format**: "Plan: [investigations], [conservative treatment] for [duration], review [timeframe]. If [condition], then [action]."

**Example**: "Plan: MRI both feet, continue physiotherapy + night splints + NSAIDs for 3 months, review after imaging. If no improvement, consider PRP injection or surgical release."

**Key Elements**:
- Investigations with purpose
- Conservative measures with timeline
- Follow-up plan
- Decision point (If-Then)

## Complete Presentation Template

"[AGE] [SEX] with [DURATION] history of [LOCATION] pain, [character], [functional impact]. [Prior treatments] with [response]. On examination, [positive findings]. [Negative findings]. Impression: [Primary diagnosis]. Plan: [investigations], [conservative treatment] for [duration], review [timeframe]. If [A], then [B]."

**Example**:

"52M with 8-month history of right ankle instability and lateral pain following inversion injury. Completed 12 weeks physiotherapy with minimal improvement. On examination, positive anterior drawer and talar tilt, neurovascularly intact. Impression: Chronic lateral ankle instability secondary to ATFL/CFL injury. Plan: MRI right ankle, continue proprioception exercises + brace for 3 months, review after imaging. If persistent instability, consider ligament reconstruction."
