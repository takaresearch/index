## 2. Plan

**Format**: Investigations → Conservative management → Follow-up → If-Then branching

**Template**:

**Investigations**:
- [X-ray / MRI / CT / Ultrasound] [LOCATION]
- Purpose: to assess [bone stock / ligament integrity / tendon pathology / confirm diagnosis]
- Expected timeframe for completion: [~4-6 weeks]

**Conservative Management** (trial for [DURATION]):
- Physiotherapy: [specific focus - strengthening, stretching, proprioception]
- Orthotics: [heel cups, insoles, AFO, night splints]
- Medication: [NSAIDs / simple analgesia] as needed
- Activity modification: [specific advice - offloading, avoid high-impact]
- Immobilization: [CAM boot / splint] if indicated

**Follow-up**:
- Review in [~3 months / ~6 weeks / after investigations complete]
- Goals: reassess symptoms, review imaging, determine next steps

**Decision Points**:
- **If improved**: Continue conservative measures, wean support, return PRN
- **If no improvement**: Consider [injection / surgical consultation / further imaging]
- **If deterioration**: Urgent review, modify treatment, reassess diagnosis

**Common phrases**:
- to assess | to evaluate | to confirm | to rule out
- for [DURATION: 3 months / 6 weeks / until next review]
- If symptoms persist → consider [next step]
- If improvement → continue conservative | wean from support

**Example**:
```
Plan
- Follow up in my clinic after investigations are complete (approx. 4 months).
- Advised to continue physiotherapy, shockwave therapy, heel cups, and night splints for 4 months while awaiting investigations.
- Investigations: MRI both feet (purpose: confirm plantar fascia pathology; assess for alternative causes of medial heel pain)
- If symptoms persist despite conservative measures → consider PRP injection or surgical release
- If improved → wean support and return PRN
```

## 3. Main Paragraph

**Format**: Opening → Chief complaint (functional) → Onset and course → Prior management → Examination → Imaging

**Template**:

**Opening**:
It was a pleasure to see **[PATIENT]** today for assessment of **[PROBLEM/REGION]**.

**Chief Complaint (functional focus)**:
[PATIENT] reports [FUNCTIONAL LIMITATION], which began [TIMEFRAME] ago [following INJURY / with insidious onset]. The main limitation is [SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL IMPACT - walking distance / stairs / work activity].

**Course and characteristics**:
Symptoms are [progressive / stable / intermittent], [aggravated by ACTIVITY] and [relieved by REST/MEDICATION]. Pain is described as [sharp / dull / aching / burning], located over the [ANATOMICAL LOCATION].

**Prior Management**:
Prior management has included [PHYSIOTHERAPY / ORTHOTICS / NSAIDs / INJECTIONS / IMMOBILIZATION] for [DURATION], with [good / partial / minimal / no] relief.

**Examination**:
On examination, gait is [antalgic / normal]. There is [swelling over LOCATION / no swelling]. Tenderness is present over [SPECIFIC ANATOMICAL STRUCTURES]. Range of motion is [full / limited] with pain at [end range / throughout]. [TEST NAME] is [positive / negative]. Neurovascular status is intact distally. Alignment is [neutral / varus / valgus].

**Imaging**:
[Radiographs / MRI / CT / Ultrasound] demonstrate [KEY FINDINGS]. [Specific findings: joint space narrowing / osteophytes / tendon tear / bone marrow edema].

**Common phrases**:
- It was a pleasure to see | Thank you for referring
- reports difficulty with | is unable to | experiences pain when
- walking distance limited to [DISTANCE]
- began [TIMEFRAME] ago | following [INJURY]
- has tried | has undergone | has completed
- with good / partial / minimal / no relief
- On examination | Inspection reveals | Palpation demonstrates
- tenderness over | swelling is present | range of motion is limited
- Radiographs demonstrate | MRI shows | CT reveals

**Example**:
```
Main Paragraph

It was a pleasure to see [PATIENT] today for assessment of bilateral foot pain. [PATIENT] presents with a 2-3 year history of bilateral foot pain, worse on the left. The pain is most severe with the first steps in the morning and after periods of rest. Walking tolerance is limited to approximately 500 meters before symptoms worsen. Stairs are difficult due to heel pain.

Symptoms have been refractory to conservative treatments, including physiotherapy exercises for 6 months, hot and cold compresses, two steroid injections (providing only brief relief of 2-3 weeks), shockwave therapy, and night splints.

On examination, gait is antalgic with shortened stance phase on the left. There is point tenderness over the plantar fascia insertion bilaterally (left > right). Range of motion of the ankle is full, but dorsiflexion reproduces plantar heel pain. There is mild heel varus alignment bilaterally. Neurovascular examination is intact. Windlass test is positive bilaterally.

Radiographs demonstrate a small calcaneal spur at the plantar fascia insertion, more prominent on the left. Joint spaces are preserved. There is no evidence of fracture or significant arthritis.

## 4. Impression and Recommendation

**Format**: Summary diagnosis → Differential → Recommendation → Follow-up goal

**Template**:

**Summary**:
In summary, [PATIENT]'s presentation is consistent with **[DIAGNOSIS]**. The key diagnostic features include [SUPPORTING FEATURES]. 

**Differential**:
The key differential diagnoses include **[DDX 1]** and **[DDX 2]**. [Alternative diagnoses that need to be considered or ruled out].

**Recommendation**:
I recommend [CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT / FURTHER INVESTIGATION / SURGICAL CONSULTATION] as outlined above. [Specific rationale for the chosen approach].

**Follow-up goal**:
I will review [PATIENT] in **[FOLLOW-UP TIMEFRAME]** to **[GOAL: review imaging results / reassess symptoms / finalize management plan / determine if further intervention is warranted]**.

**Common phrases**:
- In summary | Overall | In conclusion
- the presentation is consistent with | most likely represents
- diagnostic features include
- The key differential diagnoses include
- Other considerations are | We need to exclude
- I recommend | The plan is to | We will proceed with
- to reassess | to review progress | to finalize the plan
- to discuss surgical options | to ensure adequate healing

**Example**:

Impression and Recommendation

In summary, [PATIENT]'s presentation is consistent with chronic bilateral plantar fasciitis, more severe on the left, refractory to standard conservative management. The key diagnostic features include characteristic morning pain, plantar fascia tenderness, positive windlass test, and radiographic evidence of calcaneal spurring. The prolonged duration and failure of multiple conservative measures support the diagnosis.

The differential diagnosis for the medial heel pain includes Baxter's nerve entrapment (first branch of lateral plantar nerve), which can present with similar symptoms but may have associated numbness or dysesthesia. Other considerations include calcaneal stress fracture (ruled out on X-ray), plantar fascia rupture (no acute event, examination findings not consistent), and referred pain from lumbar radiculopathy (no back symptoms or neurological findings).

I recommend completion of the requested MRI to confirm plantar fascia pathology and assess for alternative causes of medial heel pain. In the interim, I recommend continuation of conservative measures including physiotherapy, shockwave therapy, heel cups, and night splints. If symptoms persist despite these measures and imaging confirms the diagnosis, we will consider more invasive options including PRP injection or surgical release (plantar fascia release).

I will review [PATIENT] after investigations are complete (approximately 4 months) to finalize management based on findings and clinical response. If symptoms significantly worsen before then, [PATIENT] should return for earlier review.
