# Follow-up: Post-Op Subacute - Short Presentation

## a. History Taking

**Format**: "[TIME] post [PROCEDURE]. Functional status: [key activities]. Symptoms: [pain/swelling status]."

**Example**: "4 months post left Achilles repair. Walking 5km pain-free, returned to work full-time, starting running program. Minimal swelling after exercise."

**Key Elements**:
- Time post-op
- Functional achievements
- Symptom status
- Work/sport status

---

## b. Examination

**Format**: "Examination: [scar], [ROM compared to contralateral], [strength], [functional tests]."

**Example**: "Examination: scar well-healed, ankle ROM 90% of contralateral, calf strength 4+/5, able to perform 15 single-leg heel raises."

**Key Elements**:
- Wound/scar status
- ROM (percentage of normal or contralateral)
- Strength assessment
- Functional capacity

**Follow-up Imaging Summary** (if obtained):
"X-ray: [hardware status], [healing progression], [fusion status if applicable]."

**Imaging Examples**:
- "X-ray: hardware in situ, bridging callus across osteotomy, satisfactory healing."
- "X-ray: TMT fusion progressing, ~70% bridged, hardware stable."
- "X-ray: fracture healed, hardware intact, no complications."

## c. Impression

**Format**: "[TIME] post [PROCEDURE]. [Overall progress assessment]. [Imaging status]."

**Example**: "4 months post Achilles repair. Excellent functional recovery with near-complete ROM and strength restoration. Clinically healed."

**Key Elements**:
- Recovery quality assessment
- Key outcome measures
- Imaging if relevant

---

## d. Recommendation

**Format**: "Plan: [activity clearance], [ongoing rehabilitation], [follow-up plan]."

**Example**: "Plan: cleared for gradual return to running over 6 weeks, continue eccentric strengthening program, discharge to GP care with open-door policy for concerns."

**Key Elements**:
- Activity progression
- Rehabilitation status
- Discharge vs continued follow-up

## Complete Presentation Template

"[AGE] [SEX], [TIME] post [PROCEDURE performed DATE]. [Functional status: key activities]. [Symptom status]. Examination: [ROM, strength, functional tests]. [Imaging if done]. Impression: [recovery quality] functional outcome, [achieving goals / on track / concerns]. Plan: [activity clearance], [rehab status], [follow-up: discharge / review TIMEFRAME]."

**Example**:

"35F, 6 months post right ankle arthroscopy and lateral ligament reconstruction performed 15/07/25. Walking unlimited distances, returned to gym, starting hiking again. Occasional mild swelling after prolonged activity. Examination: scars well-healed, ankle ROM equal to contralateral, strength 5/5, excellent stability on stress testing. X-ray: hardware in situ, no concerns. Impression: excellent functional outcome following lateral ligament reconstruction, achieved all goals. Plan: cleared for all activities including return to trail running, continue proprioception exercises for maintenance, discharge to GP care with open door if concerns arise."
