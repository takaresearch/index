Main Paragraph

[PATIENT] returns for review, 6 months following right ankle arthroscopy and lateral ligament reconstruction (Broström-Gould procedure with suture tape augmentation), performed on 15/07/25.

[PATIENT] reports excellent functional recovery and achievement of all preoperative goals. Currently able to walk unlimited distances without pain or instability, including on uneven terrain and hiking trails. Able to manage stairs without difficulty or need for handrail. Returned to full-time work (teaching, requires prolonged standing and walking) 3 months ago without issues. Recently resumed playing recreational basketball - has played 3 full games over the past month with no giving-way episodes, good confidence in the ankle, and minimal post-activity soreness that resolves overnight. Compared to preoperative status: dramatic improvement - was having 2-3 giving-way episodes per week and was unable to play any sport; now fully active without instability.

Pain: Essentially resolved. Occasionally (once every 1-2 weeks) experiences mild aching (1-2/10) in the ankle after very long or intense activity days, which resolves with rest overnight. No pain at rest, no pain with normal daily activities. Vastly improved from preoperative constant achiness (4-5/10) and severe pain (8/10) with giving-way episodes.

Swelling: Resolved. No residual swelling even after full day of activity or after basketball games. Initially had mild end-of-day swelling for the first 3-4 months but this has completely resolved.

Stiffness: Minimal. Slight stiffness for the first 5 minutes after waking in the morning, resolves quickly with walking. No stiffness with activities. Doesn't feel this limits function.

Instability: Completely resolved. No subjective sense of instability. No giving-way episodes since surgery. Confident on all surfaces including uneven ground. Able to jump and land without fear or sensation of ankle instability. Subjectively feels the ankle is "much more solid" than before surgery.

Rehabilitation progress: Completed 12-week formal physiotherapy program (April-June 2025) with excellent progress. Focused on ROM restoration (weeks 6-8), progressive strengthening (weeks 8-12), proprioception training (weeks 8-12), and sport-specific training (weeks 10-12). Home program compliance has been good - continued balance board exercises 3-4 times per week for maintenance. Formal therapy discharged 3 months ago.

Patient satisfaction: [PATIENT] is very satisfied with the surgical outcome. States "I'm so happy I had this done - I can do everything I want to do now without worry about my ankle giving way." Has achieved preoperative goals of: (1) return to basketball - achieved, (2) hiking without instability - achieved, (3) confident in ankle stability for daily activities - achieved. Quality of life significantly improved, no longer limited by ankle symptoms.

On examination:

Gait: Normal. No antalgic component. Normal heel strike, midstance, and toe-off phases. No circumduction. Preoperatively had cautious gait with shortened stance phase on right.

Inspection:
- Surgical scars (anterolateral and lateral ankle): Well-healed, thin, non-tender. Approximately 3cm and 5cm in length. No hypertrophy or keloid. Normal pigmentation.
- Swelling: Absent. Ankle contours symmetric to contralateral side.
- Alignment: Neutral hindfoot alignment maintained. No varus or valgus deformity.
- Muscle: No visible atrophy of peroneals or calf compared to left (had mild atrophy early postoperative period, now resolved).

Palpation:
- No tenderness over surgical sites
- No tenderness over lateral ligament complex
- No tenderness over peroneal tendons
- Anterolateral ankle: No tenderness or thickening
- Hardware not palpable (suture tape is internal)

Range of motion:
- Right ankle: Active dorsiflexion 12° / plantarflexion 48°
- Left ankle (unaffected): Active dorsiflexion 15° / plantarflexion 50°
- Right ankle: 96% of left ankle ROM (excellent)
- Preoperative right ankle: Dorsiflexion 15° / plantarflexion 50° (full ROM preoperatively; current slight restriction is common after ligament reconstruction due to intentional tightening)
- End feel: Firm capsular end feel, not painful
- Subtalar motion: Full inversion and eversion bilaterally, symmetric
- Pain: No pain throughout range of motion

Strength:
- Ankle dorsiflexion: 5/5 bilaterally (tibialis anterior)
- Ankle plantarflexion: 5/5 bilaterally (gastrocnemius-soleus)
- Ankle inversion: 5/5 bilaterally (tibialis posterior and invertors)
- Ankle eversion: 5/5 bilaterally (peroneals) - had been 4/5 at 3-month mark, now fully recovered
- Great toe extension and flexion: 5/5 bilaterally
- Compared to preoperative: Eversion strength improved (was 4/5 preoperatively due to disuse and deconditioning)

Stability:
- Anterior drawer test: Negative. ~3mm anterior translation (normal), compared to left ~3mm. Firm endpoint. Preoperatively: 10mm with soft/absent endpoint.
- Talar tilt test: Negative. ~5° tilt, compared to left ~5°. Preoperatively: 15° with marked apprehension.
- Subjectively: Ankle feels very stable to patient. No apprehension with stress testing.
- Overall: Excellent stability restored

Functional tests:
- Single leg stance: Able to maintain >30 seconds eyes open on right, >30 seconds eyes closed. Equal to left. Excellent proprioception recovered.
- Heel walking: Able without difficulty
- Toe walking: Able without difficulty
- Single leg heel raise: Able x 20 repetitions on right (equal to left x 20)
- Squat: Able to full depth without pain or instability
- Hop test: Able to perform single-leg hops on right with good control, no pain, no subjective instability. Not formally measured but appears equal to contralateral.

Follow-up imaging:

X-ray right ankle (today's visit, weight-bearing AP, lateral, and mortise views):

Hardware assessment:
- Suture tape augmentation (internal brace) present, running from fibula to talus
- Position: Stable, unchanged from 3-month postoperative X-rays
- Fibular anchor site: Well-incorporated, no lucency or bone resorption
- Talar anchor site: Well-incorporated, no lucency
- No hardware failure, no migration

Alignment:
- Tibiotalar alignment: Neutral (satisfactory)
- Hindfoot alignment: Neutral on mortise and lateral views
- No varus or valgus tilt
- Talar dome position within mortise: Centered
- Compare to immediate post-op: Unchanged, alignment maintained

Bone:
- No avascular necrosis of talus
- No fractures
- Bone density normal
- Anchor sites healed without complication

Joint:
- Tibiotalar joint space preserved (3-4mm, symmetric to contralateral)
- No evidence of post-traumatic arthritis
- No osteophytes
- Cartilage space maintained (excellent - preserved cartilage preoperatively is holding up well)

Soft tissues:
- No significant effusion
- No calcifications or heterotopic ossification
- Soft tissue contours normal

Complications:
- No hardware failure or migration
- No loss of alignment
- No development of arthritis (favorable at 6 months)
- No bone resorption at anchor sites
- No other complications visualized

Radiographic assessment:
At 6 months post-operative, X-rays demonstrate maintained alignment with stable hardware position and excellent preservation of joint space. The suture tape internal brace is in satisfactory position and well-incorporated. Most importantly, there is no evidence of post-traumatic arthritis development, which is favorable (one of the goals of ligament reconstruction is to restore stability to prevent cartilage damage and arthritis development). The bone anchor sites are fully healed without lucency or resorption. Overall radiographic appearance is excellent for this timeframe and supports the clinical finding of successful stabilization.

Impression and Recommendation

In summary, [PATIENT] has achieved an excellent functional outcome following right ankle arthroscopy and lateral ligament reconstruction (Broström-Gould with suture tape augmentation), now 6 months post-operatively. The recovery trajectory has been exemplary with steady progression through rehabilitation milestones and achievement of all functional goals well within the expected timeframe.

[PATIENT] has achieved all preoperative goals: (1) restoration of ankle stability without giving-way episodes - achieved with no episodes of instability in 6 months and excellent stability on examination; (2) return to recreational basketball - achieved, now playing regularly without limitations; (3) hiking on uneven terrain without fear - achieved without issues; and (4) pain-free daily activities - achieved with essentially no pain. Compared to the preoperative status of chronic instability with 2-3 giving-way episodes per week, persistent pain, and inability to participate in any sport, the improvement has been dramatic and life-changing for the patient. [PATIENT] is very satisfied with the surgical outcome.

Radiographic assessment at 6 months demonstrates maintained anatomic alignment with stable hardware position (suture tape internal brace well-incorporated) and, most importantly, preserved tibiotalar joint space without evidence of post-traumatic arthritis. This is an excellent finding, as one of the primary goals of surgical stabilization is to restore stability to prevent ongoing cartilage damage and subsequent arthritis that can occur with recurrent instability. The bone anchor sites are fully healed. Overall radiographic appearance supports the clinical finding of successful stabilization and is very favorable for long-term outcome.

Functionally, [PATIENT] has returned to all desired activities without restriction. Range of motion is 96% of the contralateral ankle (slight restriction is common and expected after ligament reconstruction due to intentional ligamentous tightening for stability). Strength has fully recovered to 5/5 in all muscle groups including the peroneals, which had been weak preoperatively. Proprioception has fully recovered with excellent single-leg stance performance. Most importantly, stability has been completely restored with negative stress tests and subjective confidence in the ankle across all activities including high-demand sport.

I have cleared [PATIENT] for:
- All activities including recreational basketball, hiking, and any other desired sports - no restrictions on activity level
- Full return to work without modifications (already achieved)
- No restrictions on footwear, though supportive athletic shoes recommended for high-impact activities (standard recommendation, not a restriction due to surgery)
- Gradual progression over the next 2-3 months to build sport-specific endurance and confidence, but from a healing and stability standpoint, the ankle is ready for all activities

Rehabilitation and home program:
- Formal physiotherapy has been completed and [PATIENT] discharged from physical therapy
- Home exercise program can be transitioned to maintenance level: Continue balance board exercises 2-3 times per week for proprioception maintenance (especially important for cutting/pivoting sports like basketball to reduce risk of any recurrent injury). This can be integrated into warm-up routine for sports.
- No other specific exercises required; general fitness and sport-specific training sufficient at this point

Given the excellent functional outcome, achievement of all goals, and complete resolution of the preoperative instability problem, I am discharging [PATIENT] to GP care with an open-door policy. [PATIENT] should return to see me if:
- Symptoms worsen: return of instability, giving-way episodes, persistent pain
- Trauma: new significant ankle injury requiring assessment
- Concerns: any concerns about the ankle or surgical outcome
- Routine follow-up is not required unless any of the above issues develop

Long-term considerations and counseling:

Expected final outcome: [PATIENT] is essentially at the final outcome now at 6 months. May continue to see very minor improvements in ROM and any residual stiffness over the next 6 months (up to 12 months post-op for absolute final outcome), but current status is excellent and represents successful surgery.

Risk of recurrent instability: The recurrence rate after Broström-Gould with suture tape augmentation is low (approximately 5% in the literature). The excellent stability on examination, good surgical tissue quality noted intraoperatively, use of augmentation for additional security, and patient's excellent compliance with rehabilitation all suggest a low personal risk of recurrence. That said, [PATIENT] has been counseled about the signs of recurrent instability (return of giving-way, sense of looseness) and knows to return if this develops. To minimize risk: continue proprioception exercises as part of warm-up routine, wear appropriate supportive footwear for sport, and use ankle brace for very high-risk activities if desired (though not required).

Risk of post-traumatic arthritis: The surgery was performed in part to prevent development of arthritis by restoring stability (unstable ankles are at high risk of progressive cartilage damage). The 6-month X-rays show preserved joint space which is very favorable. Long-term, there remains some risk of arthritis development over years/decades (any injury to the ankle increases lifetime arthritis risk), but this surgery significantly reduces that risk by restoring normal biomechanics. No routine X-ray surveillance is needed unless symptoms develop.

Activity recommendations long-term: No specific restrictions. [PATIENT] can participate in any desired activities. Basketball and other cutting/pivoting sports are allowed. Should wear appropriate supportive athletic shoes for high-impact sports (good practice regardless). May use prophylactic ankle brace for basketball if desired for psychological comfort, though not required from a medical standpoint given the excellent stability. Should continue to maintain good overall lower extremity strength and flexibility as part of injury prevention.

Hardware considerations: The suture tape augmentation does not require removal and will remain in situ permanently. It is well-incorporated and not causing any symptoms. No planned hardware removal. If [PATIENT] were to develop pain or prominence over the hardware sites in the future (uncommon), could consider removal at that time, but currently no indication.

What to monitor for / When to return:
- Watch for return of instability symptoms (giving-way, sense of looseness) - if occurs, return for assessment promptly
- Watch for development of persistent ankle pain, swelling, or stiffness that doesn't resolve - could indicate arthritis development or other issue - return for assessment and X-rays
- If sustains significant new ankle injury (trauma), seek assessment to ensure no new damage to ligaments or other structures
- Otherwise, no routine follow-up needed - discharged with open-door policy

Thank you for allowing me to participate in [PATIENT]'s care. It has been a pleasure to achieve such an excellent outcome. Please do not hesitate to contact me if any concerns arise in the future.

Yours sincerely,
