Main Paragraph

It was a pleasure to see [PATIENT] today for a post-operative review, approximately 3 weeks following a right total ankle replacement performed on 15/12/25.

[PATIENT] reports pain is well controlled. Current pain level is 2-3/10 at rest, 4-5/10 with movement or elevation changes. Taking paracetamol 1g four times daily and occasional endone (3-4 tablets over the past week, decreasing frequency). Pain has been steadily improving over the past week. Mainly achiness and stiffness rather than sharp pain. Some increase in discomfort at end of day but managed with elevation and ice. No night pain interfering with sleep for the past 5 days. No neuropathic symptoms (shooting pain, burning, numbness).

[PATIENT] reports the anterior wound looks good and has been staying dry. No drainage, no odor, no increasing redness. Dressing changes performed as instructed every 2-3 days. No fever or chills. No systemic symptoms. No calf pain or swelling to suggest DVT.

[PATIENT] has been strictly adhering to non-weight-bearing restrictions and managing well with crutches at home. Using knee scooter for longer distances. Independent in transfers and most daily activities. Spouse assisting with some household tasks. Able to perform ankle pump exercises regularly. No episodes of inadvertent weight-bearing.

Taking aspirin 100mg daily for DVT prophylaxis with no side effects or concerns. No issues with medication compliance.

No complications reported: no fever (has been monitoring temperature - all readings <37°C), no wound concerns, no chest pain or shortness of breath, no new neurological symptoms, no difficulties with circulation.

On examination:

Wound assessment:
- Anterior incision is well-healed, approximately 10cm in length, centrally located over anterior ankle
- Sutures removed today without difficulty
- Wound edges well-approximated with no gaps or concerns
- Minimal residual scab at inferior aspect (expected)
- No erythema, no drainage, no signs of infection
- Surrounding skin normal, no breakdown
- Swelling: Moderate diffuse swelling of the ankle and hindfoot (expected for 3 weeks post major ankle surgery)
- Temperature: Ankle slightly warmer than contralateral (expected postoperative inflammation, not concerning)
- No focal tenderness to suggest abscess or deep infection

Neurovascular assessment:
- Sensation: Intact in superficial peroneal, deep peroneal, sural, and tibial nerve distributions
- No areas of numbness or altered sensation
- Motor function: Able to perform active ankle pumps and toe movements
- Great toe extension and flexion intact
- No new motor deficits
- Vascular: Dorsalis pedis pulse palpable, posterior tibial pulse palpable
- Capillary refill <2 seconds in all toes
- Foot warm, toes pink, no concerns about circulation

Range of motion (early assessment):
- Active ankle ROM in boot: Approximately 5° dorsiflexion to 20° plantarflexion (limited by postoperative stiffness and swelling, appropriate for timeframe)
- Not pushing ROM at this early stage
- Subtalar motion deferred for now per protocol

Functional assessment:
- Performs ankle pumps well (20 repetitions demonstrated)
- Able to wiggle all toes
- No difficulty with early exercises

Post-operative imaging:

X-ray right ankle (today, weight-bearing views not performed - non-weight-bearing status):
- AP, lateral, and mortise views reviewed

Hardware assessment:
- Fixed-bearing total ankle prosthesis in situ
- Tibial component: Position satisfactory, slight anterior placement (planned intraoperatively), appropriate sizing, no evidence of subsidence
- Talar component: Position satisfactory, well-seated on talar dome, appropriate sizing
- Two anterior tibia screws securing tibial component: Position excellent, good trajectory, adequate purchase
- Overall prosthesis alignment looks good

Alignment:
- Tibiotalar alignment: Neutral (satisfactory)
- Hindfoot alignment: Neutral to slight valgus (appropriate)
- Component positioning: Tibial component approximately 5mm anterior translation relative to tibia (within acceptable range, allows adequate clearance)
- No varus or valgus malalignment
- Compare to immediate post-op films (performed 16/12/25): Position unchanged, no migration or subsidence

Bone healing:
- Bone cuts: Clean, well-apposed to components
- No periosteal reaction yet (too early)
- No evidence of early loosening or subsidence
- Bone quality appears adequate
- Note: Too early for significant bone ingrowth, but position stable is reassuring

Complications:
- No hardware failure
- No loss of alignment
- No fracture
- No significant heterotopic ossification
- Small amount of expected postoperative soft tissue swelling
- No lucencies around components (would be concerning this early)

Imaging interpretation:
Post-operative X-rays demonstrate the total ankle prosthesis in satisfactory position with maintained alignment since immediate post-operative films. Both tibial and talar components are well-positioned without evidence of subsidence, migration, or loosening at this early timeframe. Alignment is neutral, which is appropriate. No immediate complications visualized. Overall appearance is consistent with expected postoperative changes at 3 weeks.

Impression and Recommendation

In summary, [PATIENT] is progressing satisfactorily in the acute post-operative phase following right total ankle replacement, now 3 weeks post-surgery. Overall recovery trajectory is appropriate for this timeframe.

The anterior wound is healed with sutures removed today without difficulty. No signs of infection, wound breakdown, or dehiscence. Pain is well controlled with simple analgesia and steadily improving. [PATIENT] is managing well at home with non-weight-bearing restrictions, adhering to protocol, and performing exercises as instructed. Psychological adjustment to postoperative period is good.

There are no current signs of complications. Specifically: no evidence of wound infection (no fever, no systemic symptoms, wound appearance excellent, no drainage or erythema); no evidence of DVT (no calf pain or swelling, taking aspirin prophylaxis); neurovascular status remains intact with normal sensation, motor function, and vascular perfusion; no hardware failure or alignment loss on radiographic assessment. The moderate swelling present is expected for this timeframe and not concerning.

I recommend continuing the current postoperative protocol as outlined:
- Remain non-weight-bearing for an additional 3 weeks (total 6 weeks from surgery)
- Continue using CAM boot for protection and crutches for mobility
- Continue active range of motion exercises 3-4 times daily (ankle pumps, circles) within comfort
- Avoid forced dorsiflexion or inversion/eversion for now
- Continue aspirin 100mg daily for DVT prophylaxis (will continue for total 6 weeks)
- Wean analgesics as able; paracetamol should be sufficient at this point
- Elevation when resting to manage swelling
- Ice application as needed for comfort

At the next visit in approximately 3 weeks (~6 weeks post-op, around [DATE]), we will:
- Obtain weight-bearing X-rays to assess prosthesis position, alignment stability, and early bone ingrowth
- Assess clinical healing: swelling status, ROM improvement, pain level
- Determine readiness for progression to weight-bearing as tolerated (WBAT) in boot
- If appropriate based on radiographic and clinical assessment, commence WBAT phase and transition to formal physiotherapy for supervised rehabilitation

The expected timeline for recovery milestones:
- 6 weeks: Progress to WBAT in boot (if X-rays satisfactory)
- 8-10 weeks: Wean from boot to supportive shoes
- 3 months: Increasing activity and function
- 6 months: Substantial functional improvement
- 12 months: Final outcome assessment

[PATIENT] has been advised of red flags and instructed to contact the office immediately if:
- Fever >38°C or chills
- Wound changes: increasing redness, warmth, drainage, wound breakdown, odor
- Severe pain not controlled by medications or sudden increase in pain (could indicate hardware failure or other complication)
- New neurological symptoms: numbness, tingling, weakness, foot drop
- Calf pain or swelling (DVT concern)
- Shortness of breath or chest pain (PE concern)
- Any other concerns about healing or recovery

Thank you for allowing me to participate in [PATIENT]'s care.

Yours sincerely,
