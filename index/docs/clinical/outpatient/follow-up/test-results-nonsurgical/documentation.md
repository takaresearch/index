## 2. Plan

**Format**: Progress assessment → Treatment modification → Decision-point branching → Follow-up

**Template**:

**Progress Assessment**:
- Overall response to conservative management: [good / partial / poor]
- Symptom trajectory: [improving / stable / worsening]
- Functional status: [improved from baseline / unchanged / declined]

**Treatment Modification**:
- Continue current effective measures: [list]
- Modify or intensify: [add new modality / increase frequency / adjust orthotic]
- Discontinue ineffective: [treatments that haven't helped]
- Trial period: [DURATION] to assess response

**Decision-Point Branching**:

**If improved over next [DURATION]**:
- Continue conservative measures
- Wean from support [specify how]
- Gradually increase activities
- Plan for discharge or PRN follow-up

**If no improvement or worsening**:
- Consider [injection / surgical consultation / alternative diagnosis]
- Additional investigations if indicated: [specify]
- Reassess diagnosis and contributing factors

**Follow-up**:
- Review in [TIMEFRAME: 3 months / 6 weeks / PRN]
- Goals: [assess progress / determine if further intervention needed / decide on next steps]
- Earlier review if: [symptoms worsen / new concerns / red flags]

**Common phrases**:
- Continue | Modify | Intensify | Add
- If improved → wean support, return PRN
- If no improvement → consider [next step]
- If deterioration → urgent review, reassess diagnosis
- Review in [TIMEFRAME] to [GOAL]

**Example**:
```
Plan
- Imaging results reviewed: MRI confirms grade 2 plantar fasciosis with thickening and intermediate signal but no complete tear

- Treatment modification:
  - Continue physiotherapy with focus on eccentric loading exercises
  - Add night splints for sustained stretch
  - Consider PRP injection if no further improvement in 6 weeks
  - Continue activity modification and heel cups

- Decision points:
  - If symptoms resolve or significantly improve → wean from night splints, gradual return to full activity, discharge to GP care PRN
  - If minimal or no improvement after 6 weeks with intensified conservative management → offer PRP injection or discuss surgical options (plantar fascia release)
  - If symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop → earlier review to reassess diagnosis

- Follow-up: Review in 2 months to assess response. If planning injection, schedule at that visit.

Main Paragraph

[PATIENT] returns today for review, 3 months since initial consultation for bilateral heel pain.

Since last visit, symptoms have moderately improved. Pain intensity has reduced from 8/10 at worst (first steps in morning) to 5/10. Walking tolerance has increased from 500 meters to approximately 1 kilometer before onset of significant pain. Stairs remain somewhat difficult but are manageable with handrail support. Night pain has resolved. [PATIENT] reports "good days and bad days" with symptoms generally better in the afternoon after the foot "warms up."

[PATIENT] has been compliant with the treatment plan:
- Physiotherapy: Completed 8 sessions with focus on plantar fascia stretching and intrinsic foot strengthening. Continues home exercise program 5 days per week.
- Orthotics: Wearing custom heel cups daily in all footwear with good relief.
- Night splints: Using 4-5 nights per week (occasionally skips due to discomfort).
- Activity modification: Has avoided prolonged standing and reduced running frequency from 4x to 1x per week.
- Medication: Taking ibuprofen 400mg as needed, now only 2-3 times per week (previously daily).

Currently, [PATIENT] describes the heel pain as "significantly better but not resolved." Main persisting problem is first-step pain in the morning, though less severe and shorter duration (5-10 minutes vs 30-60 minutes previously). Able to work full-time in teaching role with some modifications (avoiding excessive standing, wearing supportive shoes, taking seated breaks).

On examination, gait is improved with minimal antalgic component (previously moderately antalgic). No visible swelling. Point tenderness over the plantar fascia insertion is present bilaterally but markedly reduced in intensity compared to baseline (2/10 vs 7/10 on palpation). Range of motion: Ankle dorsiflexion 10 degrees with knee extended (baseline 5 degrees), no longer reproduces severe heel pain. Windlass test remains positive but less painful. Calf flexibility has improved with gastrocnemius stretching protocol. Neurovascular examination intact.

Imaging Review:

MRI both feet (performed [DATE]):

Left foot (more symptomatic):
- Plantar fascia: Thickened to 6.5mm (normal <4mm) with intermediate T1 and increased T2 signal in the proximal plantar fascia, consistent with grade 2 plantar fasciosis. Fibers remain in continuity with no evidence of complete tear. Some peritendinous edema.
- Calcaneal marrow: Mild bone marrow edema at the plantar fascial enthesis, consistent with enthesopathy.
- Other structures: Achilles tendon normal. No stress fracture. No Baxter's nerve entrapment evident (no mass or abnormal signal along course of first branch of lateral plantar nerve). Plantar fat pad preserved.

Right foot (less symptomatic):
- Plantar fascia: Mildly thickened to 5.2mm with subtle signal change, consistent with grade 1 plantar fasciosis.
- Calcaneal marrow: Minimal bone marrow edema.
- Other structures: Unremarkable.

Clinical-Radiological Correlation:
MRI findings of grade 2 plantar fasciosis on the left (more symptomatic side) with associated enthesopathy and bone marrow edema correlate well with the clinical presentation of chronic plantar fasciitis. The degree of inflammation and thickening explains the persistent symptoms despite conservative management. The absence of complete tear is favorable and supports continued conservative approach. The lack of evidence for alternative diagnoses such as Baxter's nerve entrapment, stress fracture, or other pathology supports the primary diagnosis. The imaging findings, combined with partial clinical response to conservative measures over 3 months, suggest that more intensive conservative management (with possible PRP injection if this fails) is reasonable before considering surgical intervention.

Impression and Recommendation

In summary, [PATIENT] has chronic bilateral plantar fasciitis, confirmed on MRI, with partial response to conservative management over 3 months. Functional status has improved significantly (walking tolerance increased from 500m to 1km, reduced analgesic use, able to work with modifications), though symptoms are not fully resolved. The persistent first-step morning pain and ongoing activity limitation indicate the condition has not fully resolved.

MRI confirms the diagnosis of plantar fasciosis (grade 2 on left, grade 1 on right) with associated calcaneal enthesopathy and bone marrow edema on the more symptomatic left side. The degree of inflammation and structural change correlates well with the prolonged symptom duration and partial response to treatment. Importantly, there is no complete tear, which is favorable for continued conservative management. The absence of alternative pathology (Baxter's nerve entrapment, stress fracture, other causes of heel pain) supports focusing treatment on the plantar fascia.

Given the partial but meaningful improvement over 3 months, and the relatively short timeframe since initiating intensive physiotherapy and orthotics (full benefit may take 6-12 months), I recommend continuing and intensifying the current conservative approach before considering more invasive options:

1. Continue physiotherapy with focus on eccentric loading exercises and intrinsic foot strengthening - evidence supports 6-12 month trial
2. Add night splints consistently (every night if tolerable) for sustained stretch - may improve morning symptoms
3. Continue heel cups and activity modification
4. Consider extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) if available - moderate evidence for chronic plantar fasciitis
5. Trial period: 6-8 weeks with above intensified regimen

Decision points:
- **If symptoms continue to improve or resolve** over the next 6-8 weeks: Gradually wean from night splints, progressive return to full activities including increased running, discharge to GP care with open-door policy for return if needed.

- **If minimal or no further improvement** after 6-8 weeks of intensified conservative management: Consider PRP (platelet-rich plasma) injection. Evidence is mixed but may provide benefit in refractory cases. Alternative: corticosteroid injection (though concerns about plantar fascia rupture limit enthusiasm for this option). Discuss risks and benefits at that time.

- **If symptoms significantly worsen** or new concerning symptoms develop (severe sudden pain suggesting rupture, progressive neurological symptoms, signs of systemic disease): Earlier review to reassess diagnosis and management.

I will review [PATIENT] in 2 months to assess response to this intensified conservative regimen and determine whether injection therapy or, as a last resort, surgical intervention (plantar fascia release) is warranted. The goal is to achieve adequate symptom control to allow return to desired activity level without need for surgery, as surgical outcomes are variable and recovery is prolonged.

Thank you for allowing me to participate in [PATIENT]'s care.

Yours sincerely,

[ADDRESS]

Re: [PATIENT NAME], DOB: [DATE]

Dear Dr. [REFERRING DOCTOR],

Diagnosis
- Chronic bilateral plantar fasciitis (L>R), confirmed on MRI
- Partial response to conservative management over 3 months
- MRI demonstrates grade 2 plantar fasciosis with no complete tear

Plan
- Continue and intensify conservative management: physiotherapy, night splints (nightly), heel cups, activity modification
- Consider ESWT if available
- Trial period: 6-8 weeks

- Decision points:
  - If improved → wean support, return to activities, discharge PRN
  - If no improvement → consider PRP injection or discuss surgical options
  - If worsen → earlier review

- Follow-up: Review in 2 months to assess response and determine if injection or surgery needed

Main Paragraph

[PATIENT] returns for review, 3 months since initial consultation. Symptoms have moderately improved: pain reduced from 8/10 to 5/10, walking tolerance increased from 500m to 1km. [PATIENT] has been compliant with physiotherapy, heel cups, night splints (4-5 nights/week), and activity modification.

On examination, gait improved, minimal antalgic component. Plantar fascia tenderness markedly reduced (2/10 vs 7/10 baseline). Ankle dorsiflexion improved to 10 degrees. Windlass test positive but less painful.

MRI both feet: Left foot shows plantar fascia thickened to 6.5mm with increased T2 signal (grade 2 fasciosis), no tear. Mild calcaneal bone marrow edema. No Baxter's nerve entrapment or stress fracture. Right foot shows mild thickening (grade 1 fasciosis).

Impression and Recommendation

In summary, [PATIENT] has chronic bilateral plantar fasciitis confirmed on MRI with partial response to 3 months conservative management. MRI confirms grade 2 plantar fasciosis with no complete tear (favorable for conservative approach). Given meaningful improvement and relatively short intensive treatment period, I recommend continuing and intensifying conservative management (consistent night splints, consider ESWT, continue physio and orthotics) for 6-8 weeks. If no further improvement, will consider PRP injection. Review in 2 months to reassess.

Thank you for allowing me to participate in [PATIENT]'s care.
